## ~/Whoami 

{{< typeit >}}I am not the loudest in the room, nor the fastest on the keyboard. But in the silence between requests and responses, in the heartbeat of network traffic, I see what others miss. 

I don’t chase vulnerabilities; they reveal themselves to those who understand the language of systems. Firewalls, packets, and encrypted whispers, I listen where others overlook.

I have learned that security isn’t just about defense; it’s about knowing where the cracks begin. From compromising the intentionally weak to fortifying the strong, my path is one of understanding, not destruction. {{< /typeit >}}
