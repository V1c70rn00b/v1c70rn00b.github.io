"Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water.
If you put Water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottleand it becomes the bottle.
You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

Now, water can flow or it can crash.
Be water, my friend.🌊🌊"

 The following are responsibilities I was tasked with and I was able to deliver;

- Vulnerability Assessment: I performed a comprehensive scan on a target 
website to identify open ports and pinpoint potential security vulnerabilities. 

- Penetration Testing: I carried out brute-force attacks and directory 
enumeration to expose hidden directories and files within the website. 

- Traffic Analysis: By intercepting network traffic with Wire-shark during a 
simulated login, I successfully captured and analyzed the credentials being 
transmitted. 

- Decryption and Cryptanalysis: I decrypted password-protected files using 
cryptographic tools and analyzed hash values to retrieve plaintext 
passwords. 

- Reverse Engineering: Utilizing PE Explorer, I examined an executable file 
to locate the entry point and extract other vital information. 

- Payload Creation: I developed and deployed a Metasploit payload, 
establishing a reverse shell connection on a virtual machines
