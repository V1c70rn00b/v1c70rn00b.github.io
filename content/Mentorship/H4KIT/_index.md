## Bootcamp Instructor

During May 2025, I got the priviledge to teach in a cybersecurity bootcamp held by [H4K-IT](www.linkedin.com/company/h4k-it/). I was required to take the students through the topic of introduction to networking, where I was to teach the students the importance of understanding networks as a cybersecurity practitioner. 

Below are the videos to the recording where over 20+ students got to listen and understand the topic.

After the bootcamp I then got awarded a certification as a sign of good and outstanding mentorship to the students.
